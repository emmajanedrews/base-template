We’re excited to announce our team’s latest endorsement. This one comes from nationally syndicated radio host Glenn Beck. **He had some great words to say about our team and about our home sale guarantee program.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

In case you haven’t heard of it, here’s how it works. We guarantee to sell your home at a price and deadline that you agree to or we are going to buy it ourselves. **We sell a home every two days,** and have a large network of buyers that are looking for a home right now. We make this promise because we know we have the systems in place to keep it.

To hear the full radio endorsement, listen to the clip above.
