*There’s a new-build community with a handful of brand-new D.R. Horton homes available that you might be interested in if you’re a buyer.*

If you’re thinking of buying a home, there’s a new-build community in southwest Las Vegas with a limited number of great D.R. Horton homes available that I’d like to tell you about.

You can get a glimpse of what these homes offer in the video above, as I’m standing in one of them. This community started about a year ago and it’s already almost sold out. The homes here were estimated to sell out in three years’ time, but the market is so hot that they only have five available lots left.

**There are both two-story and single-story homes available, and they all come with highly rated upgrades.** The single-story homes measure out at 3,700 square feet and come on large lots that are roughly one-third of an acre. They also come with three-car garages attached. There are only three two-story homes left, and they measure out at roughly 2,700 square feet and are listed at just under $400,000.&nbsp;

We at Vegas Capital Realty have a lot of incentives we can offer you that you can use as a credit toward your closing costs or any upgrades you’d like to make yourself to these homes if you let us help you buy one of them, so don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you’re interested.&nbsp;

If you have any other real estate questions or you’re thinking about selling a home in our market, feel free to call us directly for a free consultation. We’d love to speak with you.
