Do you know how Futurity Assessment got its name or what our process is?

A couple years ago, I was visiting a client in Chicago and having a conversation with their CEO. The conversation took a unique shift.

We were talking about how important it was that the company focused on how they would prepare for the future and not just on how they were performing today. At that point, the CEO told me that no one was actually speaking to him about the future readiness of his organization, and&nbsp;**if that's what I wanted to talk about, he'd actually stand up and listen.**

Obviously, this conversation was very impactful to me. When I got home from the trip, I knew I had to find a name that really defines future readiness. Just like everyone, I hopped online to start and I found the word 'futurity.' Oddly enough, 'futurity' is actually a horse show in which young horses are judged on what their future abilities look like.

We took that premise and designed it for companies.

So, the company **Futurity Assessment is a process or tool that companies can use to benchmark themselves against what their future abilities look like.**We focus on four key areas:

**Employment branding** - what's the value proposition the company has for its employees and how does it relate to retention?

**Leadership potential** - who can the company groom for leadership roles in the future and what is their succession plan?

**Putting together development and growth strategies** - we actually design a future organization chart for the company.

**Process mapping** - this is where the organization can uncover where they need to be more efficient in their processes.

The goal of our company is to bring the future into the present so that companies can design the future they want instead of experiencing unwanted consequences they didn't prepare for.

If you have any questions about our company or you're interested in working with us, please reach out to us soon. We'd love to start an impactful conversation about your company's future.
