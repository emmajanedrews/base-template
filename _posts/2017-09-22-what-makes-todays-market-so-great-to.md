Today I’m bringing you a quick look at our market’s latest numbers as well as some key listing tips.

We’ve had a good hot summer this year in Crystal Coast, and the real estate market in our area is seeing that same heat.

Now that the summer has come to a close, it’s time for a market update.

First of all, it’s interesting to note that the total number of sold properties is up from last year by 217 homes. **The average list price and average sold price are both also up, each having risen by $9,000.**

Another factor we’re seeing is a shorter number of days on market. The average days on market has actually gone down since last year by about 47 days.

If you’re thinking about putting your house on the market, it’s a great time to do so. Inventory is very low right now, so the market is in need of properties.

Whether you plan to list this month or a year from now, there are a few key things you can do to prepare. For one thing, upgrading your countertops is always a great idea.

Another area that buyers look at closely is flooring. **I would wait to change out carpet until you’re close to listing, but vinyl and hardwood can be put in any time.**

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want more listing tips, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
