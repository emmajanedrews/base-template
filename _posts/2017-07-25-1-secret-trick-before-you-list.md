When it comes to selling a property, it is never too early to get a jump start on the process. Today, we want to let you in on a secret that can save you thousands: a pre-marketing home inspection.

We teach future home sellers each month at our seminar how to sell for up to 18% more. One of the ways to do this is by fighting off the “staging shark.” **Real estate is a new world these days, and it’s a world where differentiating your home from the others is essential.**

I’ve taught over 1,000 home sellers so far, and from doing so I’ve learned that most sellers want three key things. They want to sell for the most money, in the least amount of time, and they want to sell hassle free.

Having a pre-marketing home inspection takes care of all three of these points. When you get your home inspection taken care of prior to listing, you’re saving yourself a lot of money. If you discover anything in your property that needs a repair, you can choose from Cardano’s List—a compilation of business contractors my team and I trust to meet your needs.

When you have your inspection done in advance, you can have repairs done at your own pace and with your own preferred contractors instead of ones chosen by the buyer.

Additionally, buyers love being able to read home inspection reports as well as any receipts from the repairs you’ve made. This makes buyers more comfortable and will let them make you a clean offer at top dollar. In fact, a recent statistic says that 100% of home buyers feel more comfortable buying a pre-inspected home.

A pre-home inspection also saves you time, since most buyers won’t feel the need to perform another after seeing your report. This eliminates the 14 to 21-day contingency period, and offers tend to be submitted in just days.

This strategy means home sellers don’t need to worry about a buyer backing out because of a home inspection. All cards are on the table. **Sellers will be able to put their market on the home feeling confident that they’ve already taken care of all repairs.**

So make sure that when you’re listing your home, you choose an expert advisor who utilizes this strategy.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
