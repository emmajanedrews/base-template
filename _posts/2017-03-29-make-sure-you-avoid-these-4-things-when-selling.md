If you hope to sell your home in 2017, there are four things you should definitely avoid.

**1. Overimproving the home.** If you want the best price for your home, updates and improvements need to be made. However, overimproving could hurt your sale. For example, you could put in a $40,000 pool, but an appraiser will probably only give you $10,000 in value for it. That’s why we do a free consultation to let you know exactly what improvements need to be made to increase value and ensure top dollar for your home.

**2. Renovating without permits.** You need to get a permit for any work that the county requires a permit for. For example, if you build a deck without a permit and it doesn’t adhere to the required specifications, an inspection will uncover that and a buyer might want you to rebuild it. That’s going to cost you a lot of money.

**3. Limiting showing hours.** We understand you don’t want a potential buyer popping by to look at your home when you’re sitting down for dinner. However, limiting showings to 24 hours notice also limits the amount of traffic, or potential buyers, that can see your home. I suggest asking for a two-hour courtesy notice so you have time to ready your home and move your schedule around. Also, if you work during the day, make sure your home is show-ready when you leave.

**4. Not listening to your Realtor.** You don’t need to follow your Realtor’s advice blindly, but if they take the time to give you suggestions, you need to consider them. What you see on HGTV isn’t always going to be accurate in relation to your specific situation. That’s why we make sure you understand the process and strategy to sell your home before we even put it on the market.
