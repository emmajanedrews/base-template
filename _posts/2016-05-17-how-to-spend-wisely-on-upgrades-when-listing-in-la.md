If you’re considering selling your home, when is the right time to call your Realtor to get your home ready to go on the market?

Recently I had some clients spending time and money on things that I actually thought weren’t important to get top dollar in their market.

Before you spend that time and money, just give me a call! I’ll come out and give you a free market overview and point out some things that as a Realtor, I think are important to fix up in order to sell for top dollar. Too many times sellers invest in upgrades that are nice in their eyes, rather than thinking about what will appeal to buyers.

We want sellers laser-focused on the best ways to spend the least amount of money to get top dollar in today’s market.

Reach out to me and let’s do a walkthrough. I look forward to seeing you soon!
