{% include youtube.html %}Today, I wanted to discuss our annual pie giveaway and give you a quick market update.

For years, our team has been giving away pies to all of our fans. It’s that time of year again, and we already have people calling us to RSVP for their pie. Because we’re so grateful to our wonderful community for supporting our business, giving you a pie is the least we can do.

To RSVP, please call us at (843) 972-3833 by the November 17th deadline. You can then pick up your pie at my office at 496 Bramson Court, Suite 200 in Mount Pleasant. The dates available for pickup are Nov. 21st from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Nov. 22nd from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Now, what’s happening in the Charleston real estate market? A lot of sellers are taking their houses off the market because they presume that there aren’t as many buyers out there. That is true; however, in midsummer, housing inventory hovered around 4.2 months, and now it’s at 3.9 months. That means you currently have better odds of selling your home now than you did a few months ago.

How? There are fewer buyers, but there are also even fewer sellers. That means less competition for you to deal with.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email for a free consultation or a free home evaluation report. I look forward to helping you!
