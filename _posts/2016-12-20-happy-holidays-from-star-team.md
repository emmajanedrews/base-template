We had a wonderful year in 2016, and as it comes to a close, we wanted to wish you a merry Christmas and happy New Year. There's a special story we'd like to share.

We're definitely in the holiday spirit here at the Star Team, so we wanted to take a moment to deliver you a special holiday greeting as the year winds down. This year was a great one and we want to thank you for buying and selling property with us, as well as everyone who sent us referrals.

We hope to help even more families in 2017, so if you or anyone you know are looking to buy or sell a home on the Crystal Coast, we'd love to hear from you!

During the season of giving, let us take time to slow down and appreciate the job of spending time with family and friends and appreciate the true reason for the season. **We hope this special time of year touches your heart in a special way.** In the spirit of the season, I have a story that was recently shared with me that I wanted to pass along.

During a cold day in New York City some years ago, a lady approached a 10-year-old boy who had no shoes and was shivering in front of a shoe store window. She said "My, you're in such deep thought staring in that window," to which he replied, "I was asking God to give me a pair of shoes."

The lady took this little boy by the hand and took him inside where she asked the clerk for several pairs of socks for the little boy. Then, she asked for a basin of water and a towel so she could wash and dry his feet. She put new socks on his feet and bought him a brand-new pair of shoes. She gave him the rest of the socks, patted him on the head, and said, "No doubt you will be more comfortable now."

As she turned to leave, the boy grabbed her hand, and with tears in his eyes, he asked her, "Are you God's wife?"

With that in mind, from our team to your family, we wish you a very merry Christmas and a prosperous, happy New , happy New Year.
