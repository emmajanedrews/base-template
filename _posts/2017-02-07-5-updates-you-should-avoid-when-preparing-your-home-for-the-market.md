Video Summary:<br>If you plan on selling your home, here are five updates that you should avoid making before you list it:

**1. Wallpaper.** You don’t want to add wallpaper unless it’s a custom home or you’ve been asked by a custom designer to add wallpaper.

**2. Lavish light fixtures.** Your light fixtures should be clean and simple. Buyers don’t like to overspend, and most of them won’t see the value in lavish light fixtures.

**3. Replacing carpet with carpet.**&nbsp;In older homes and high-traffic areas like hallways and living rooms, we find a lot of carpeting. In this case, I recommend you replace that carpet with high-quality laminate flooring or hardwood flooring. You can find very good entry-level engineered hardwood flooring at a similar price to carpet, and it would only take a day or two to replace any areas you desire

**4. Painting in bold colors.&nbsp;**Don’t go with and bold reds, greens, or blues. Keep your colors clean, neutral, and calm. Buyers will appreciate that.

**5. Overspending on the landscaping.** Usually, you won’t get a good return on your investment anyway when it comes to landscaping. Although you want to update the curb appeal for your home, you don’t want to overspend.
