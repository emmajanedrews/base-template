When you make your first offer on a home, it needs to be a strong one. There are a couple of main reasons why.

When you make your first offer on a home, you need to make sure that it’s a strong offer. Why?

**First of all, there’s the matter of etiquette to the seller.**

For example, let’s say that a seller lists their property at $800,000. It just hit the market and you see it over the weekend for the first time. You make an offer at $750,000.

Now, the seller hasn’t been on the market long enough to accept that offer. They might counter offer and they may even accept your offer at $760,000. However, they will continue to show that property to other buyers. They will also look for every chance to kill that deal.

The other thing to keep in mind is that once another buyer knows that you’ve already made an offer on the property, they will go in with a stronger offer than yours. **Don’t give another buyer a chance to steal your dream home away.**

Go in with a strong offer, get in and out of attorney review, and try to get to the closing table as soon as possible.

If you have any other questions about buying a home in today’s market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
