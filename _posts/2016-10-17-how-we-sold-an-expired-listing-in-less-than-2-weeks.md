We recently sold a property for more than list price in less than two weeks. Prior to working with us, these clients had their home on the market for over six months before the listing expired.

During that time, the property had six showings and no offers, so the sellers were understandably frustrated. When they were referred to us, I told them exactly what they needed to do to get the property sold.

The first thing you need to understand is curb appeal. If you look at the video above, you will see before and after pictures of the property. I had the clients paint the exterior of this beautiful log home because the photos from the original listing showed that the home had deferred maintenance. Everybody on the Internet judges a book by its cover, so your home needs to look good.

Imagine going to an expensive restaurant and paying $50 for a plate of food. That plate of food will come out looking good, and because it looks good, it’s going to taste better. The same principle applies to buying a home.

 If you look at the video above, you will see a couple of interior photos as well. Before, the property had not been staged. I found that the clients were more than happy to stage the home but their prior agent didn’t give them any direction on what to do or how to do it. We went room by room and staged the property correctly. For instance, we referred them to our countertop guy so they could finish updating the kitchen. It cost $1,500 to replace the countertops and they look great.

When you look at a listing online, after the exterior photos, the buyer should see a picture of the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom in exactly that order. Those three rooms are the most important to buyers and most buyers will only look at your listing for a little bit, so you need to post photos of those rooms up front in order to grab their attention.

We are incredibly grateful to these clients. They did everything that we asked them to do. We launched the property using our grand opening technique and, as a result, we sold this property in fewer than two weeks.

If you have any questions about the home selling process or if you’re having trouble selling your property, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
