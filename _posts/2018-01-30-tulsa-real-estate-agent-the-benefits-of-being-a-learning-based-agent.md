There’s always more to learn as a real estate agent. Here are just a few examples.

I’m excited to be joined today by my amazing friend, Jessica Starr, a Keller Williams agent out of Connecticut and Lower Massachusetts. I talked to her a little bit about why being learning-based is so important as an agent, as well as about some of the different trainings and learning opportunities that KW offers.

Jessica’s favorite course is probably BOLD, judging by the fact that she’s taken it a dozen times. There are so many different opportunities out there for KW agents, though, that **Jessica says you should start building a plan for all the events you want to attend in December or January.** Take a look at the training calendars in your office, then determine which ones you want to attend. Jessica advises booking KW Family Reunion and Mega Camp first. A few other courses that Jessica recommends are Quantum Leap and the Language of Sales.

You should also make it a point to attend a few masterminds. They can be a game changer. **When you're working with people who are doing things at a high level, the conversations and relationships you build are huge and can help you out for the rest of your career.** Even though it’s a cost to attend, the referrals alone that you’ll get from other agents make it worth the price of admission.

The bottom line is that all successful people are learning-based. Jessica and I actually filmed the video above at a Mastermind event in Chicago. If you or someone you know needs real estate assistance in Connecticut or Massachusetts, give her a call at (860) 761-3765 or send her an email to StarrRealtyGroup@gmail.com.

If you have any other questions for me about your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
