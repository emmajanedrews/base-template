excerpt: 'What does our real estate market look like now that we are done with the first quarter? I’ll go over some numbers from this year and compare to 2016 to give you an idea of what’s changed and what has stayed the same. We’ve had quite a bit of precipitation this year which played a huge part on the first quarter numbers. Luckily, I am quite confident we are in a position for a great second quarter. To get all the details and see what’s going on with real estate in your area, watch this short video.'

How did we fare in the first quarter of 2017?

We had a long winter with lots of snow followed by a lot of rain. We are almost at 100% above average for precipitation this year, which affected first quarter activity.

First, on all the lakes combined, there were 10 residential sales this year compared to eight residential sales last year. However, there were only two vacant lot sales this year compared to four last year.

**Flathead Lake** has 89 residential active listings and 42 vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there were seven residential sales, zero vacant sales, and four pending sales compared to seven residential sales, two vacant sales, and one pending sale in the first quarter of 2016.

**Swan Lake** has 12 residential active listings and 10 vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there were zero residential sales, zero vacant sales, and zero pending sales compared to one residential sale, one vacant sale, and zero pending sales in the first quarter of 2016.

**Echo Lake** has six residential active listings and three vacant active listings. Neither 2017 nor 2016 saw any residential or vacant sales in the first quarter, but there is one pending sale compared to zero pending sales last year.
