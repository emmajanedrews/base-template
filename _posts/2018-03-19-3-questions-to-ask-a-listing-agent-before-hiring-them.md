What three questions do you need to ask a listing agent before hiring them?&nbsp;

**1. What sets them apart from other agents?** For example, here at BTG Real Estate, what sets us apart is our team approach. We compartmentalize each section of our business so each person is the absolute best at what they do.&nbsp;

**2. What type of marketing plan will they be using?** Most agents use a three-point plan: they put a sign in the home’s yard, put the home on the MLS, and pray that some other agent sells it. You need an agent who’s proactive and has a system behind what they’re doing to market and sell your home.&nbsp;

**3. Can you cancel your contract?** We’re a relationship-based business, and we want to make sure our clients are comfortable throughout every step of the process. If at any point during that process they’re not feeling comfortable, we’d rather turn them down today then let them down later at a critical juncture, which is why we have an easy exit listing option.
