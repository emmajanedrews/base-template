**Did Ocean City Development do what they said they were going to do when they were going to do it?**

*"Yup."*

**Did everything go smoothly?**

*"Yup."*

**Did you feel like they were helpful throughout the process and did you feel that you were treated fairly?**

*"Oh yes, very much so."*

**In the end, were you happy that you ended up selling to them and would you recommend another seller in a similar situation do the same?**

*"I tell people about them if I can."*
