I read an article recently that said less than 10% of all people have written goals of any kind, and 90% of the population is walking around every single minute on everyone else’s agenda.

The same article stated that 80% to 85% of all New Year’s resolutions made at the beginning of the year are totally gone by now because people don’t have the structures and systems in place to execute their goals.

How can you be a part of the percentile that makes goals and achieves them?

**This week, I hosted a webinar where I interviewed Paul Cummings**, author of the book “It All Matters: 125 Strategies to Achieve Maximum Confidence, Clarity, Certainty, and Creativity.” I asked Paul some really neat questions about what you need to have in order to engage and execute your goals. He put together a 10-step process on how to build your goals, and he included nine area goals as well that you need to have to create a great work-life balance.

**To watch the full webinar, <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/recording/recordingView?webinarKey=6463891808849661443&registrantEmail=victoria@woople.com&assets=true&utm_content=buffere7c64&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">click here</a>.**

What are you going to do differently this year? If you keep doing the same thing, you’ll get the same results. By implementing the strategies Paul talks about in his book and outlines in this webinar, you’ll be able to bring your 2018 game to the next level.

If you have any questions about this webinar, how to set goals, or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
