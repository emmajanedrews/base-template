If you have a pet and you're looking to sell your home, then read on for some helpful advice.

The good news is many homebuyers are looking for a pet-friendly home.

Two out of three of us have a pet, and 61% of pet owners say they have trouble finding a home that is a good match for their pet.

In fact, a recent survey estimates that **31% of animal owners frequently don't put in an offer because a home would not suit their pet.**

This means that if your home is a good match for a pet, it will be attractive to a large pool of dedicated animal owners.

On the other hand, 67% of Realtors also estimate that actually having a pet in your home can make it harder for you to sell.

So what can you do? Here are three things I typically recommend:

**1. Repair any damage**

Floors, walls, doors, the yard — these are some typical areas that pets love to chew, scratch, and dig up.

Repairing this damage is an investment that will pay for itself many times over in terms of a higher selling price.

**2. Get a professional to remove pet odors**

Many pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers will be.

That's why you should hire a professional cleaning crew to clean any carpets, rugs, or upholstery that have absorbed pet odors.

Once you're done with the cleaning, ask a friend or your Realtor for a sniff assessment to make sure the job is really complete.

**3. Take your pet out during showings**

Some people are afraid of animals. Others are allergic. And regardless of the time, money, and effort you've put in to clean and repair your home, many buyers will be prejudiced by knowing that a pet currently lives there.

That's why I recommend taking your pet out during showings and also removing any pet objects such as toys, food bowls, or scratching posts.

By following these three simple guidelines, **you will be able to sell your home for top dollar, whether the buyer is a pet owner or not.**
