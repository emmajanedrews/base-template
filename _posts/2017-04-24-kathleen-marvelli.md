**What would you like other agents to know about Tom Cafarella?**

*If you work for Tom there are no limits. I believe that what you put into it is what you get back out of it when you work for him. He is a brilliant, young entrepreneur who really creates a lot of opportunities for his agents and investors so whatever you’re willing to put in, he’s got plenty of opportunities to give back. That’s how I feel about it.*

**What has been your experience working on his team?**

*It’s a good one. I’m not real close to their office, I’m a little far way. But it is a big, warm welcome family so I feel as if I can reach out and there’s always somebody there at almost any time, whether I needed some help, virtually in any sort of way there’s always someone to reach out to with the team.  So it really doesn’t matter where I’m located.*

**How is Tom different?**

*I think that he’s looking at real estate, not as a crowded, in other words over-saturated, real estate can seem over-saturated. A lot of people don’t want to get into it because it’s over-saturated. It doesn’t matter to him because there’s still room for another entrepreneur to create many different opportunities in a different way with different thinking. And I think that’s what he’s come across. So it doesn’t matter what else is out there, there can still be more but in a different way, his way.*

**Is there anything else you'd like to share?**

*I really do think the best way to create your future in this is to create it.  And he has allowed everybody an opportunity with his tools to create what it is they are looking for.
