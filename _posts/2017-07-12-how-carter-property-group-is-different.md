As a transaction coordinator and operations manager, my job involves handling the benchmarks and communication from the time a property goes under contract all the way through closing.

Between attorneys, other agents, clients, lenders, and appraisers, about six other people enter the transaction once a property goes under contract.

What this means is that I communicate with all of these people to make sure we’re on track with hitting all the dates in the contract, making sure all agreed-upon money is delivered, and to ensure the process goes smoothly overall.

Additionally, I make sure that the client is in-the-know all the way through the process.

After getting my license in 2005, I worked first as an individual agent before meeting Ashley in 2008.

One of the things I found most interesting about my job with The Carter Property Group is that I’ve been put in a position where I’ve done the things I am best at.

There’s a high level of customer service, communication, and organization here. The opportunities I’ve found here remind me of the reason I got into real estate to begin with.

So if you’re interested in working with us or have any other questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
