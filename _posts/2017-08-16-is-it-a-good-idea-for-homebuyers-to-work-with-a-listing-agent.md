Does working with a listing agent benefit you as a homebuyer?

**Not really**. You’re much better off working with someone who will get you the best deal and make sure you’re properly represented. We’re not inferring that a listing agent won’t do that, but we can speak from experience when we say that agents who are more dominant on the listing side can’t give a buyer all of the attention they need when they want to look for houses.

This is why we have a buyer’s team who is very well trained and knows how to write a buyer’s offer so that it gets accepted. They’ll take you out and show you not only our listings, but every other agent’s listings in the area that meets your criteria too. Hopefully, we can also put you in touch with a lender and make your offer even stronger.

Remember—**listing agents are hired to represent the seller first**. This means that as a buyer, you’re secondary to them. Think of it this way—if you went to court, would you hire the same attorney to represent you that’s representing the other person? Probably not.

The best way to get a great deal as a homebuyer is to go in strong with someone who will represent you properly and with whom you can feel comfortable with knowing they have your best interests at heart.

If you have any questions about finding the right representation or any other real estate topic, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to speak with you.
