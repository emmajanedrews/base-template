There are four vital statistics that every agent needs to know when selling luxury properties.

1. **Understand what luxury home prices start at in your market.** I know certain people define luxury properties as anything above $1 million across the board. But, this simply isn’t fair. $1 million in Silicon Valley will get you a lot less than $1 million in Iowa. That being said, you need to understand the analytics for your market. My own team and I define the luxury market as anything that is at least three times the average sale price for a given market.
2. **Know how many months of inventory there are for luxury homes in your market.**A given area might be a seller’s market overall, but the luxury market within that area could be seeing completely different conditions. While the market in general for a certain location might have very little inventory, for example, the luxury market in that area might have 12 to 16 months of inventory. As a reminder: a buyer’s market is any market where there are seven months of inventory or more; a seller’s market is a market with inventory levels at four or fewer months; and an even market has between five and six months of inventory.
3. **Know what price point a buyer’s market starts at.** This could be a price point above or below the threshold of the luxury market, but most markets will have a point where buyers are in control.
4. **Understand list-to-sale ratios.**In other words, if a home is listed at $1 million and it sells for $850,000, that would constitute a 85% list-to-sale ratio. It’s important to be informed about current list-to-sale ratios in both the luxury and general market.
