  Today I’d like to tell you the tale of two home inspections. If a buyer backs

It’s time for me to tell you the tale of two home inspections.<br>

We had a property on the market in Fairfax where the original buyer backed out. The buyer claimed they backed out due to the home inspection, but I know this wasn’t the case. The simple truth is that they got cold feet.<br>

Only a matter of days later, another buyer came to the property and went under contract. This buyer ordered a home inspection, which gave us the opportunity to see two different inspections on the exact same property within about a five-day period.<br>

This is where things got interesting. The two home inspections were both done by professionals, but ended up being completely different. Because they found completely different things to fix within the home, the buyers asked for completely different things following their respective inspections.<br>

It’s because of scenarios like these that we encourage our sellers to negotiate a credit instead of fixing specific items. This just makes more sense, since the likelihood of two home inspections being exactly the same is slim to none.<br>

I’ve seen this kind of situation many times in our business. If you aren’t careful, you may end up making fixes on home inspection items for a buyer who will ultimately back out, only to be asked about making completely different repairs from the next buyer.

Understand that there will always be things within your home that you never noticed or cared about but that will be important to a buyer.<br>

Don’t make any hasty repairs before you list. There are certain things you should definitely fix, but sometimes those things aren’t what you might think. We can help you determine the right repairs, and help you move forward with your listing. The right repairs will make all the difference.<br>

Even if you aren’t considering selling for another year, my team and I would still love to get in touch. The earlier you call, the more we can do to put you in the position to win.<br>

If you have any other questions or would like more information. Feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
