If you’re a seller, what are a some ways you can maximize your opportunity? Today, I’ve got two methods to share.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.sellwithsikora.com/cma/property-valuation/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report.</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.sellwithsikora.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

How can you maximize your opportunity as a seller?

Today, I’ve got a few tips to share on how to do just that.

**First of all, remember to schedule around holidays.** Avoid timing sales within the two weeks prior to a holiday or within the last two weeks of August.

Inventory and conditions overall will tend to pick up outside of those times.

Next, try not to be overly selective about offers. In today’s economy, getting an offer in general is a win. You don’t want to pass over a good thing in the hope that something even better will come along.

Don’t let yourself miss out by waiting for the next best thing.

Accepting offers, even ones that are lower, doesn’t mean you have to stop showing the property until you’re under contract.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
