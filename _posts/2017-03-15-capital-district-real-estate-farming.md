 I had a conversation with an agent a few weeks ago who was working with some out-of-town buyers. He was working in a few different neighborhoods, but felt bad because he wasn’t doing enough prospecting in order to find more listings.

 When he ended up driving through one of those neighborhoods, he was sad to see two yard signs on two different properties. They weren’t his signs however. They were from his competitors. That tends to make any agent feel crappy. However, I told him not to lose sight of his goals and I offered him a few tips on how to better market to different neighborhoods he was working.

 **One of the things that works best for me and my team is a monthly newsletter.** I present a lot of different information from housing market statistics to community updates and even recipes. I also include testimonials, data from recently sold homes, and information about any special events we have.

 By getting in front of our geographic farm areas with a newsletter like this, we are always top of mind with homeowners. **This helps us get more listings, more buyers, and more business in general.**

 Another way we like to reach out to entire neighborhoods is by sending out mailers for different charity events we do. For example, we had a canned food drive for the local food pantry and it was a huge success. We gave away free ice cream to everyone who came and donated a can. **We only spent a few hours and a few hundred dollars, but it was a great way to give back to the community and keep us top of mind.**

 Finally, “just listed” and “just sold” postcards are alway a smart idea. It lets people know what their neighbors’ homes are selling for and it’s a great way to insert testimonials into your marketing material. People always trust referrals, so this is an important step to building up a good reputation in an area.

 These are just a few of the ways you can up your marketing in geographical farms to attract more buyers and sellers. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
