In our current market, many people buy into the misconception that agents get super rich off of seller commissions.

Today, I’d like to illustrate where those commission funds actually go during a real estate transaction.

**For the sake of easy math, let’s imagine a world where the commission fee is just $1.&nbsp;**Out of that $1, the listing agent will give back half to the buyer’s agent. Of the 50 cents that are left, the agent will give half to their broker.

This leaves the agent, so far, with just 25 cents left from the original $1 commission. Out of that 25 cents, the agent is paying for their own health insurance, retirement fund, gas and insurance for their car, and self-employment tax.

For RE/MAX agents, that 25-cent amount is split up a little differently. There’s a monthly management fee, the costs of travel, marketing expenses, office rent, health insurance, signs and lockboxes, and more.

**With all of the out-of-pocket expenses agents pay, there isn’t much of a profit left over after everything is said and done.&nbsp;**That being said, it’s easy to see that agents like myself are in this business because we truly want to help you succeed with your real estate goals. It isn’t about the money—it’s about serving our clients.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
