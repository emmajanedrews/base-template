Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that rises out from the ground, enters our home through the foundation and, right now, it is the leading cause of lung cancer in No. 2 leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.

Between the months of October and March, Davis County actually provides free radon testing for residents. You can file a request for this test **[here.](http://www.co.davis.ut.us/health/environmental-health-services/environmental_testing/radon/radon-form)**

Here are some startling numbers: **56% of homes in Centerville, 42% of homes in Bountiful, and 20% of homes in North Salt Lake City tested above the healthy EPA levels for radon.**

When you’re buying a home, I highly recommend having a radon test performed. I also recommend having your home tested whenever you make significant changes or remodels, especially to the lower level.

**If your home tests high or positive, you can purchase a radon mitigation system.** This system uses a fan to pump air through the house to eliminate radon.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
