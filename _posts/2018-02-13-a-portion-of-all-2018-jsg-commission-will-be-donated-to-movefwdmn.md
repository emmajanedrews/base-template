  We are super excited to announce that the John Schuster Group has aligned
  itself with a great nonprofit organization called MoveFwd. The group’s aims
  match our mission statement and our core values, which include gratitude. Out
  of gratitude comes generosity, and we want to give back to the community. 
  Located here in the Eisenhower Community Center, MoveFwd provides a range of
  services for the community, including providing housing assistance for
  homeless youth from ages 15 to 24.  Today, I’m with Sarah Granger, the
  executive director of the organization, to dive further into the group’s goals
  and values.  MoveFwd has been serving the community for 27 years, serving
  young people and their families in the western suburbs. Their focus is to work
  with youths and their families with mental health issues as well as housing
  instability. This could be from needing an emergency place to stay for one
  night to needing longer-term stability in a housing program or in an apartment
  of their own.  The housing program allows MoveFwd to house eight to 10 young
  adults for up to two years, where they can receive rental subsidies as well as
  support to develop independent living skills.   Kids can stop into the drop-in
  center every day for support, which is open Monday through Thursday, from 2:30
  p.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The John Schuster Group is very excited to lend its support
  to this program by donating a portion of our commissions to help fund the aims
  of the organization. There is an immediate need right now for donations in the
  form of gift cards to places like Target, Chipotle, and Uber. Additionally,
  donations of toiletries like ethnic hair care products are appreciated, as
  well as anything you’d think you’d need if you were moving into a studio-style
  apartment.   We’re proud to have partnered with such an important community
  service. We find that it’s important for everybody to have a place to live. If
  you’d like to help out with the program, please feel free to reach out the
  program at http://movefwdmn.org/.   For any questions about real estate, you
  can reach out to the John Schuster group directly. We’d be happy to help you.

The group’s aims match our mission statement and our core values, which include gratitude. Out of gratitude comes generosity, and we want to give back to the community.
