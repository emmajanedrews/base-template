What can you expect if you join the Brad Korb Real Estate Group? I’ve brought in Naira Ambartsumyan, one of our buyer specialists and team leaders, to talk about her experience joining our team and how it helped her career:

“When I was considering joining a real estate group, there were so many options, but the only one that stuck out and made sense for me was being a part of the Brad Korb Real Estate Group. Why? **I get to work one-on-one with a broker who’s been doing this for over 38 years.**He’s super knowledgeable and he’s always just a hand’s reach away to answer any of my questions. I had a great mentor when I started here myself, so being able to help others who are starting in real estate is a true blessing, and I’m super excited to do that.”

If you’re thinking about joining our team or you have any questions about how we can jumpstart your real estate career, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
