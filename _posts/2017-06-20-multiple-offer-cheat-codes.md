We’ve had to deal with quite a few multiple offer situations recently. These can get tricky, but we have been able to find consistent success in getting buyers the home they want while competing against other buyers who want the same home. We are here to share some of our best tips with you today.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**The first important thing is to make sure your agent tells the sellers your story**. Striking an emotional chord with a seller will go a long way when it comes time for them to accept an offer. A lot of sellers are interested in the buyer who will live in their home next. You want your agent to present your case to the sellers as strongly as possible.

<br>We recently had a buyer who was a nurse at a local hospital and ended up getting her offer accepted because of the seller’s connection to the nurses at that hospital. **Making sure the deadlines on the offer are nice and tight is another good strategy**.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Finally, you need to have a solid pre-qualification letter from a lender that your agent has a relationship with. If they have closed many transactions with that lender, you can rest assured that you won't be led astray.&nbsp;
