I’m here at The Wynn in Las Vegas for a Leading Real Estate Companies of the World Conference. The top real estate companies in the world are here, along with over 3,000 agents who are attending five days of masterminding and networking. It’s been incredible.

In one of the sessions, they talked about the importance of using videos. **The open rates, engagement levels, and response rates videos have are higher than email—even text.**

A representative from BombBomb talked about how most people know the importance of video but just don’t do it. They may not like the way their voice sounds, the way they look, or they may want to lose 20 pounds before they start.

His point was, you just have to get over it. People love you for who you are and they do business with who they know, like and trust.

We work with BombBomb and we’ve been doing videos for a couple of years. We get great responses from buyers, sellers, and even prospects.

Think of all the prospects that you call and you can’t get them on the phone. You can actually create an evergreen video to send them as a follow-up. This is a generic video that just says, “Hi, I see you visited my website. I tried reaching out but couldn’t get ahold of you, so I wanted to shoot a quick video. I have some important information for you, so please respond back.” Your engagement will be much better.

Just try it. If you don’t want to get into BombBomb, you can shoot a video on your phone, upload it to YouTube, create a link, and send it out from there.

**There are many ways to do video, but the point is to get started now!** You can even send me your first video if you want a few pointers.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have. I would be happy to help you! Please call/text me at 518-376-1073 or email me at <a href="mailto:wmiranda@mrgteam.com">wmiranda@mrgteam.com</a>.
