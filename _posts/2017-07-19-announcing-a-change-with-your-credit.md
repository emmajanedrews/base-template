Today I wanted to talk to you about some exciting news that I just heard about.

The three credit agencies are changing the way that they’re reviewing credit scores, so **12 million people are going to their scores boosted anywhere from 10 to 20 points.** This is exciting news for the consumers. With a higher credit score, you can get a lower interest rate and with a lower rate, you have more buying power to get a more expensive home.
