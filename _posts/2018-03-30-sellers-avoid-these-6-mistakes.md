Today, I’m here to share with you the six biggest mistakes homeowners make when selling their homes.

Preparing a home for the market can be a stressful process. However, avoiding these common mistakes will make the home selling process a lot smoother.

**1. Picking the wrong agent.** The right agent will answer their phone when you call and will get back to you in a timely manner. They’ll also be knowledgeable about the market and will be honest and straightforward with you, rather than just agreeing with whatever you say.

**2. Overpricing your home.** Even a well-priced home with bad marketing can sell, though it may take a bit longer.

**3. Failing to make simple repairs.&nbsp;**If the dog chewed something up or if there are other minor damages, a buyer will spot them instantly. Make those repairs before you list your home on the market.

**4. Neglecting to declutter your home.** This is a big point; buyers start their home searches online, and if the pictures of your home are showing off all the stuff inside instead of the areas that buyers are attracted to, there is a great chance the buyers will move past your listing. Pack up your personal stuff and store it away so that it doesn’t get in the way of your showing.

**5. Not allowing adequate access to your home.&nbsp;**I have found that for every 10 times a seller says they can’t show a home on a certain date, eight of those 10 buyers won’t even come back. Some Realtors won’t even call to reschedule the appointment. It’s very important that your home is show-ready at all times and that you can get agents and buyers in and out of the house when they want.

**6. Getting emotional about your house.** Sellers can sometimes be very attached to their homes. However, when you sell your property, you need to think of your house as a property, not your home. Now, if someone gives you a lowball offer or wants to remodel, you should be okay with it as long as the buyers are paying you a fair market price.
