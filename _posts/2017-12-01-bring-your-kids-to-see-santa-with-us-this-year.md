  Seeing Santa at the mall can take a long time and cost a pretty penny for a
  few photos. That’s why we’re having Santa come to us this year, and you’re
  invited to come see him.

One of the frustrations our families have encountered the last couple of years during the holiday season is waiting in long lines to see Santa at the mall and paying a lot for pictures once we got the chance.&nbsp;

That’s why we’ve decided to have Santa come to us this year, and you’re invited to join us when he does. **On December 11 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., bring your kids to see Santa with us at the Gateway Condominiums at 5 S. 500 West 5th Floor here in Salt Lake City**.&nbsp;

We’ll be serving hot chocolate and treats, and you’ll also have the chance to snap a few photos before checking out the lights downtown. We’ll have our own camera as well, so if you don’t have one, we can take pictures for you and email them to you.
