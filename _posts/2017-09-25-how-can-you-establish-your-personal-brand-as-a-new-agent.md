How can you establish your personal brand as a new agent? It’s not as difficult as you think it is.

First of all, you have to **define why you are doing what you’re doing.** From there, you can establish the values you have within your team or within your business if you want to be a solo agent.

Think about the people you want to impact, why you want to impact them, and what kind of market you want to work in.

Once you define that, you can develop your own personal image. Since you don’t have anything to fall back on as far as your business image, it’s a great time to recreate that for yourself.

Pick things for your logo that are emblematic of your own values. That will ring true for the culture you have for your business when you meet with new clients or hire new people. It’s really important to identify those values and make sure people see them through your marketing.

**Finally, determine your unique selling proposition as a Realtor.**What makes you unique? Why would someone hire you as opposed to a different Realtor?

There are many things you can offer to set yourself apart. We offer different guarantees so that our consumers know we have a higher level of accountability. Some people decide to work within a defined area and become an expert in that area. No matter what it is, choose something that makes you unique and differentiates you from other Realtors out there.

Everyone has a relative or friend in real estate. You need to make sure that you stand out from the crowd and come up with good reasons why people would like to work with you.
