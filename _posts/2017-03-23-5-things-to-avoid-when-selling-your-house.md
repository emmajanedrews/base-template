Video Summary:<br>If you're getting ready to sell your house, there are certain things you should actually avoid doing:

**1. Wallpaper is out.** Unless your home is custom-built, you want to avoid putting up wallpaper at all costs.

**2. Lavish light fixtures.** You want to keep your fixtures clean and simple; you don't need to overspend or get something ornate and personal.

**3. Carpeting.** Many older homes have carpet in the high-traffic areas like the hallways and living rooms. Don't replace carpet with carpet. Instead, use a high-quality laminate, a good engineered hardwood, or real hardwood floors. You can find good engineered hardwood at a reasonable price that would be similar to the cost of carpet, and it usually only takes a day or two to replace.

**4. Bold colors.** If you need to repaint your property at all, avoid bold colors like bright reds, yellows, and greens. Go with neutral colors to appeal to more buyers.

**5. Landscaping.** You can focus on curb appeal, but don't spend too much money on it. You'll get a negative return on your investment with landscaping.
