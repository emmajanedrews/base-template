  Getting a home inspection is a very important part of a real estate
  transaction. Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, being in the know about the
  home inspection will make the process go much smoother. Today, I’m joined by
  professional inspector Fred Larsen to tell you everything you need to know
  about home inspections. For example, home inspectors are not required to have
  a license in Utah, so you better make sure you know exactly who you hire. To
  find out what else you should know about home inspections, watch this short

Today I am joined by Fred Larsen from Pillar to Post Home Inspection to answer some common questions about home inspections. So what should you expect when you’re inspecting?

**The most common issues found during home inspections are water related.** Water can get into the house by grading and draining from the exterior, rain gutters leaking, leaking around flashing, and through improperly installed roofing and siding materials.

If you are looking to sell a home, a good first step is to get your gas appliances checked and serviced to make sure that they are safe for use. Of course, it’s also a good idea to address any of the water issues previously mentioned. Take care of anything you know needs to be taken care of before the inspector gets to your home.

**Getting your home pre-inspected also boasts a ton of benefits.** Doing so will save you lots of time and money. Also, when your home in under contract, it will save you the headache of trying to scramble to get everything fixed or repaired during the due diligence period.

If you’re a buyer ordering a home inspection, make sure to get it done early in the due diligence period. There may be some things that the inspector finds that you’ll want to be checked out further. Also, make sure you find a good home inspector by asking your agent for referrals and interviewing potential hires. It’s always a good idea to ask for a sample report, as well.

It’s important to understand that **a home inspection is a visual inspection.** Home inspectors don’t tear things apart or dig through walls, and there are things they can’t see. Fred and his team try to be as thorough as possible, though; they cover up to 1,600 items.

Keep in mind that Utah does not require a license to do home inspections, so make sure you get an experienced and qualified home inspector.
