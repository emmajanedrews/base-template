What’s going on in the market now that interest rates have gone up?

Since the election ended, rates have jumped up. The Fed is talking about raising rates three more times throughout 2017.

Buyers are pouring into the market now in order to lock in a low interest rate. If they wait to buy, they will likely get stuck with a higher interest rate.

There is light inventory right now, which is beneficial to home sellers. If you’ve been thinking about selling your home, I recommend getting on the market as soon as possible. Buyers are ready to make a purchase now and you won’t face as much competition from other sellers. 

If you have any other questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
