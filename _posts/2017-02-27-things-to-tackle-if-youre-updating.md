If your property is out of date, you might be wondering what updates you should make before putting it on the market. I’ll go over the best projects you can do to add value and prepare your home today.

First and foremost, you want to be strategic and economical about the updates you undertake, but keep in mind that upgrades are crucial as buyers are very critical.

The areas you’ll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.

For the kitchen, **you’ll want new countertops, a new sink and faucet, new hardware for the cabinets and drawers, and new appliances.** You should also consider adding a backsplash or at the very least, painting. Those things will get you the most bang for your buck in your kitchen.

As far as the bathroom goes, the first thing you’ll want to look at is the condition of the flooring. Also, make sure you take a look at the area surrounding the tub and/or the shower, as well as the condition of the vanity.&nbsp;**The good news is that vanities and sinks are generally inexpensive upgrades.** Another inexpensive update to consider is adding a new light fixture as that will really make the bathroom pop.

Updates can bring some pretty significant returns and there are ways to update your home on a budget. On the other hand, **if you really believe you don’t have the money to upgrade those rooms, you’ll need to be prepared to sell at a lower price.**

One of the things my team and I have successfully done over the years is help navigate sellers to the best upgrades for their homes that will have the best returns. If you’re thinking about selling, we can definitely help you key in on the things that will be the most important to buyers.
