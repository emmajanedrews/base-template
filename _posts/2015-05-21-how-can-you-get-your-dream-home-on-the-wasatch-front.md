Hey guys, thanks for coming back. If you are a buyer, you've likely noticed that the market is hot. We have very little inventory, but there are several things you can do to help you and your offer stand out in this market.

The first thing you want to do is make sure you secure a strong pre-approval letter. Have your lender run you through a desktop underwriting system and share it with the agent when you submit your offer. Another thing you can do is write a letter to the seller, letting them know everything you love about the property. Be passionate, sometimes sellers will surprise you with how they respond to heartfelt communication.

Asking the listing agent what is important to the seller is a good idea. Maybe they don't care as much about price as they do a closing date or shortened inspection period.

Watch out for closing costs. When buyers ask sellers to pay closing costs in this market, it's going to be problematic. Chat with your lender about how much you need, and make sure you don't take a cent more.

 Finally, you can submit an escalation clause, which is a way you can get the seller to accept an offer that is above all other offers by a specified amount. Presenting the offer in person is a good idea as well.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. Talk to you soon!
