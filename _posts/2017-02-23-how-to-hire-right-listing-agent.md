Hiring the right real estate agent to sell your house is absolutely crucial. Here are four tips to help you choose the best agent for the job.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

When you plan on selling your house, it is crucial to hire the right agent. How do you know which agent is the best one for the job? Here are a few tips:

**1. Work with an agent who specializes in selling houses.** Don’t work with a buyer’s agent. Listing agents are experienced in negotiating with buyers. They know what to do to sell your home and will give you the best advice to help you move forward, avoid surprises, and net the most money.

**2. You should hire an active agent.** Over 80% of agents only sell four properties a year. They are not actively working in the real estate industry every day to sell homes.

**3. Ask how much experience they have.** You need an experienced agent who has seen both the peak and the lowest point of the market. They will know how to handle every situation that may arise during the transaction. Keep in mind that some experienced agents only do four deals a year, so ask how many transactions they do as well.

**4. Ask for references.** Ask the agent for three or four references. Check their past sales on Zillow and other review sites to make sure that you hire a good listing agent.

Keep these four things in mind when hiring a listing agent and you will hire the right one for the job. If you have any other questions about selling your house, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
