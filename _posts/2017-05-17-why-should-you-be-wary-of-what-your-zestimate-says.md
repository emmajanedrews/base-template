What is a Zestimate?

You can visit Zillow for the full definition, but it’s basically **an algorithm that gives you an estimate of your home’s worth.** It’s calculated by using public and user-submitted data regarding different features of the house, the location, and other market conditions. It’s the same approach most real estate agents use, but Zillow relies on large-data websites for homes across the country.

**Zestimates tend to be within 5% to 15% of the home’s true value.** I’ll use the actual property that I live in as an example of how this fluctuates.

When I bought this property, its Zestimate was between $265,000 and $270,000. As I updated the information that Zillow had for it, the value went up and then varied a bit over time. As of this week, I’m selling this property for $318,500 and its Zestimate is $313,000. In my case, my Zestimate was off by 10% to 15% when I started and is within 2% now.

So, are Zestimates accurate representations of a home’s worth? Even Zillow **encourages buyers and sellers to supplement their Zestimate with other researched information.**

The first thing you can do to supplement your Zestimate is get a comparative market analysis from a real estate agent. With a comparative market analysis, your agent will pull similar comparable homes from with your neighborhood to determine your home’s worth. Another thing you can do is hire an appraiser, which will probably cost a couple hundred dollars.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller wondering if a Zestimate for a particular property is accurate, the best thing you can do is reach out to your agent so they can narrow its real worth down to a more specific number.

If you have any questions about Zestimates or are thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love the chance to help you.
