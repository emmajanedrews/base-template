What inspections should you have done on the home you’re buying? Here’s a few to get you started.

Why should you have a home inspection when buying a home? Which inspections should you order? The first answer is obvious, but the second is not.

**Home inspections protect your investment as a buyer.** If your home has a plumbing issue that may cost you thousands of dollars to repair down the line, wouldn’t you want to know about it before committing to purchase it? That’s the idea of home inspections.

However, there are many different kinds of home inspections, so which is right for you? I’m going to go through a few of them today and explain how the process works.

For starters, every homebuyer should have a building inspection that is completed by a certified home inspector. They will give you an overview of any problems in the house you are buying. They aren’t plumbers or electricians, but they are very knowledgable and will be able to spot a problem when they find it.The inspector will take note of any and all problems. **They can then refer you to a professional who can better estimate the repairs.**

The inspector will spend at least a few hours in the home (around four hours for a 2,500 sq ft. house) and it’s important that you are with them every step of the way. It will help you better understand their findings and what you can do resolve any issues.

Aside from the building inspection, a gas inspection is another important one to consider. In the past, they were done by the local utility company. Now you can hire your own HVAC contractor to perform tests and make sure that any gas powered appliances are following the proper code.

The last inspection I wanted to mention today is the sewer lateral inspection. **If you’re not buying a brand new home, there is a possibility that the plumbing underneath your home is made of old, clay pipes.** A sewer lateral inspection will alert you to any creaks, leaks, or invasive roots blocking your sewage lines.

These are just a few of the many inspections you can choose to have done on a home. Stay tuned for part two, where we’ll cover even more ground. In the meantime, if you have any questions for me at all don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you
