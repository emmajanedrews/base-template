I have some great news to share today about the St. Charles real estate market.

In the last year, the number of homes on the market has decreased by 11.9%, the average days on market has decreased by 7%, and showings are up by 13%.

**These powerful figures indicate that now is the time to get on the market if you’ve been thinking about buying or selling a home anytime in the near future.**

If you have any questions for me or want to know how to get the process started, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
