Right now, the interest rate market is incredible. We are seeing most people get rates in the mid-3%’s, which has drawn tons of buyers into the market earlier than expected. This is why we are telling sellers to get their homes on the market as soon as possible, because these low rates are only going to continue to attract buyers.

Even in the last few weeks, interest rates have fallen. In addition to that fact, there are a ton of different down payment assistance and first-time buyer programs out there that are making homes a whole lot more affordable than they used to be.

If you have any questions for us about interest rates or the real estate market in general, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
