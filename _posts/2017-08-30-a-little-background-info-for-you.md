I recently received an email from a good friend of mine that had some great questions in it. They were so good, in fact, that I wanted to answer them for you today.

A friend of mine, Jim Mcallister, recently sent in an email that asked a bunch of questions about my career. I thought I’d answer them today so you all can get to know a little bit more about me too. **Here are Jim’s questions and my answers.**

**How did you get into the business?** I started in real estate at a young age. My grandfather had transitioned from a career as a successful salesman to a successful real estate agent and found it was a good fit. He eventually talked me into moving back to Minnesota from Seattle to learn the business directly from him. 40 years later, here we are. My grandfather was a great teacher, and I've done my best to carry on his legacy.

**Why do I stay in the business?** The main reason is because it interests and excites me. It keeps me on my toes while giving me an opportunity to help people accomplish their goals and make one of the biggest investments of their lives. I love helping growing families, empty nesters, and everyone in between. The best part is having conversations with these people years later about how we made such a big difference for them.

If you have any questions for me or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in St. Cloud, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
