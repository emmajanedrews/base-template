Hey everyone, we are back on the Wasatch Front with a special guest today, Chris Van Leeuwen, who has access to a mortgage product that covers 100% financing, with a forgiving grant. We have invited Chris in to tell you about this grant today.

The national home buyer grants offered by First Option Mortgage come with either a 3% or 5% grant for FHA financing, and a 3% grant for conventional financing. The thing we really love about this product is that you don't have to be a first-time home buyer to have access to it.

If you've owned in the past but don't currently own a property, you can be eligible for this grant. You do have to meet some credit score and income requirements, but you can now get an FHA loan with a 640 score.

The really great news about this grant? YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY IT BACK! It's a true grant, that is forgiven on the day you move into the house.

For those of you who want to see if you can qualify for this grant, give Chris a call today at [(801)-809-0213](tel:801-809-0213).

 If you have any questions for us, we are always here to take you call or email! Talk to you soon!
