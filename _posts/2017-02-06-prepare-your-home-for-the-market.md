As a home seller, what can you do to get your home ready for the photo shoot, the market, and for buyer showings?

When potential buyers pull up to your house, the outside needs to be just as inviting as the inside. This means having your bushes trimmed back, your driveway and home pressure washed, fresh light bulbs, and maybe some fresh cut flowers. **If the exterior of your home is in disarray, that buyer may just keep driving** because they got a bad first impression of your home.

As they walk through your front door, it’s important to have all of your carpets vacuumed and your home smelling clean and fresh.

You should also make sure that your home is free of all personal items. Take down family photos and make sure that there aren’t any books stacked on the counter or above cabinets. You want the buyer to feel like this can be their home, and if your personal stuff is lying around everywhere, they will feel like they are intruding in someone else’s home.

It’s important to have all of the smaller items in your home functioning correctly. Check on cabinet hinges, sliding glass doors, and more.

During the showing, we recommend that you have jazz music playing or cookies baking. Doing so will show buyers that you have pride in homeownership. **We provide a professional stager to all of our clients.** The stager will come in and let you know what you need to do to make showings fantastic. Sometimes just switching out the comforters on the beds or adding a new lamp makes all the difference. Little changes go a long way; you don’t have to spend a lot of money to make your home more appealing to buyers.

Hopefully some of these tips will help you sell your home faster and maximize your price. It’s all about the little touches and the experience the buyer has from the moment they pull up in front of your home. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
