I offer all types of mortgages, but my specialty is making sure military personnel can buy their dream homes.

It doesn't cost a penny to talk....<a href="http://texas-vet-loans.com/contact/" target="_blank">so call me right now and I will answer your questions!</a>

I’m a loan officer here at Guild Mortgage in San Antonio and a mortgage expert. Although I do offer conventional, FHA, and all other different types of loans, **my specialty is helping military personnel with their home loan needs.** I’ve been doing this for the past 15 years.

One of the unique things I do is meet with my clients in person. A lot of our competition doesn’t do this anymore, but I think it’s important to be able to talk to someone in person when going through the home buying process. There are a lot of options to choose from and a lot of paperwork needed to determine what you qualify for.

If you have any questions for me, I would be glad to answer them. I’m here six days a week in my office and when you dial me, you will talk to me. I don’t have a receptionist or assistant answering my calls for me. I’m here for you, so don't hesitate to give me a call. It doesn’t cost a thing to talk to me on the phone. I look forward to hearing from you.
