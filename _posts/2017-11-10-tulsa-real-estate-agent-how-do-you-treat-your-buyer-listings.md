We’ve been able to do a much better job of handling our buyers
by adding one simple tool to our business.

Today I’d like to share something cool with you. It’s a system our team uses for buyer listings that was developed by my friend Brian Inskip. It’s called My Buyer Listing. Essentially, it’s a website where you can post your buyer listing information and have a system behind it and a plan for how to share the listing with your network and your neighborhood.

All of us post seller listings all the time and share them with our networks. **Why not do the same thing with our buyer listings?** I like to think of it as a dating game for houses. Maybe a homeowner isn’t thinking about selling until they see that there is a buyer on this site that is clearly looking for a home like theirs. Wouldn’t that be cool to match up with a buyer or seller in advance and not even have to list the home?

I just wanted to share this tool with you to help you get in front of more buyers. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
