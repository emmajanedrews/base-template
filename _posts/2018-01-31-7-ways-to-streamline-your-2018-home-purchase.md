If you’re buying a home in 2018 and would like to have a smooth, successful transition, here are a few tips you might want to consider.

**1.** **Check your credit often.** There could be items on your credit report that you may not know about.

**2. Don’t open new credit cards** or make big purchases. It’s good to have great credit card history showing timely payments and no late fees.

**3. Have a savings account.**

**4. Ask family for cash gifts** on special occasions. A big-screen TV for your birthday might be great, but having a home to put it in is even better. This extra cash can also be put towards home inspections, closing costs, and furnishings.

**5. Keep tabs on the interest rates.** Whether rates are going up or down, remember that you may not qualify for the very best interest rate; it depends on your credit history, job history, and who your lender is.

**6. Work with a lender.** It’s never too early to begin working with a lender. You need to find out your purchasing power before you start calling the Realtor to visit potential properties. Do this by getting pre-approved early in the process. The lender will also be able to advise you on special programs that could help you with the loan.

**7. Give me a call.** I’ll be able to help you through the process of searching for properties, getting to the closing table, and owning your own home. The Star Team at Bluewater Real Estate has a buyer’s guide that is very helpful with the entire process from start to finish.
