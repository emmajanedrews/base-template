We recently had a question about how to better handle telephone interviews or virtual (Skype) interviews. I am going to elaborate a little bit on this topic today.

In both of these instances, you want to make sure you’re prepared and know your skills, your accomplishments, and how those things benefit the person you’re interviewing with. Secondly, you want to make sure you’ve done your research on the hiring authority, their background, and their accomplishments. Finally, you’ve got to do your research on the company. **The more prepared you are, the more confident you will be.**

For telephone interviews, the best tip I have for you is to stand up. By standing up, you will have more energy in your voice and in terms of how you bring across the information that is relevant in the interview.

When you’re doing a Skype interview, it’s not as simple. You typically have to sit down in that situation, so standing up can be difficult. **The big thing to remember is to keep distractions at a minimum.** That means making sure everything shown on camera is neat and anyone else in the house with you knows to keep loud noises at a minimum for the duration of your interview.

If you have any questions about this topic or want to learn more interview tips, give me a call or send me an email. I would be glad to discuss this topic further with you.
