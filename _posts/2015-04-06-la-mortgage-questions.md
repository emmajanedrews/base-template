Hey everyone, happy April to you. First off, I wanted to say thank you so much for sending in all of your great questions. I'm going to answer a few of them today for you. Most of them have had to do with mortgages, refinancing, and interest rates, so we thought we would bring in Brian McKim of Skyline Home Loans to help answer them.

How often can I refinance?
This is a great question. You can refinance as many times as it makes sense for you. There are no longer any pre-payment penalties, so you can refinance 2 or 3 times a year if it makes sense to. What we mean by "making sense" is that if the refinance will save you money down the road and you can afford it, you should do it.

When and how can I refinance if I'm planning to sell in the future?
If you are planning on selling in the next 18-24 months, it probably doesn't make much sense for you to refinance. You'll want to give yourself enough time to reap the benefits of getting a lower rate, and that probably won't happen for at least 2 years.

There you have it. Thanks to Brian for joining us today and helping answer some of your questions. If you have any more questions for us, or for Brian, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to be of assistance to you!
