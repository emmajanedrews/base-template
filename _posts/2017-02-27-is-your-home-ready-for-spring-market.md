The spring market is just around the corner, and there are three simple things that you can do to prepare your home to sell for top dollar:

**1. Deep clean your home.** Hire a professional cleaning crew and have them clean the windows and regrout the tubs. People do not like to see the mildew in the bathroom, so this is an easy way to make your home more appealing to buyers.

**2. Get rid of all clutter and personal items.** Put things in storage or in cabinets. No matter what, make sure your countertops are clean and take all of the magnets off of the fridge.

**3. Add a fresh coat of paint.** Choose a neutral color, like a nice, basic gray. That will go a long way to make your home look fantastic.
