        "content": "EGGFest is a unique event with delicious food; but the eggs here aren’t what you think.Today, Sandie and I are coming to you from the annual EGGFest at Brownsboro Hardware &amp; Paint.Before we move on to what’s going on here at EGGFest, let’s talk a little bit about our market. The first piece of news is that interest rates, while they’re staying steady for now, won’t stay as low as they are forever.But what about our local Louisville market? For one thing, the number of homes sold in July is down 2.3% from where it was last year. This is all due to a lack of inventory—15.1% fewer homes are on the market than there were last July.This puts us firmly in a seller’s market. In fact, right now we’re sitting at 2.93 months of inventory. However, homes in higher price ranges are seeing something much different. While lower-priced homes are moving more quickly off the market, higher-end homes are actually in a buyer’s market.In other words, people looking to sell and make the move up to a higher price range are in a great position. They’ll be able to sell their lower price point home for top dollar before turning around to get a fantastic deal.Currently, lower-priced homes are in strong demand. Many people are growing tired of renting and are ready to become homeowners. Overall, the market is hot—especially in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range.In fact, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun recently said that “Homes are are coming off the market at an extremely fast pace and the prevalence of multiple offers in some markets are pushing prices higher.” This is something we’re absolutely seeing here in Louisville.But let’s get back to EGGFest.  According to Jim Lehrer of Brownsboro Hardware &amp; Paint, this is the festival’s ninth year—and this year’s turnout is bigger than ever before. Last year, EGGFest raised over $20,000 for two local charities. With such a great crowd, the money raised this year is expected to far exceed last year’s number.The atmosphere at EGGFest is unlike anything else. But these aren’t the kind of eggs you cook—they’re the kind you cook with. Throughout the event there are rows and rows of Big Green Eggs—kamado-style ceramic charcoal barbeque grills. As is obvious from all the delicious looking and tasting food, these Big Green Eggs can cook just about anything.“THESE BIG GREEN EGGS CAN COOK JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.”One attendee we spoke to, Jamie Longacre, said she couldn’t choose a favorite between all the things to eat here at EGGFest. “You can’t go wrong here,” she told us.From pork to burgers to pizza to even real eggs, there’s no shortage of things to try. In fact, even first-time attendees have said they already own, or plan on getting, their very own Big Green Egg.We spoke to attendees and vendors alike, but the consensus was the same across the board: the food is delicious and the event is like nothing else around.Some of the things to try here are as unique as the event itself. Dan Lambert, one of the chefs at EGGFest, was even making what he called “grilled lemonade.” The finished treat was a half lemon dipped in sugar, caramelized on a grill, and then made into lemonade.There are even certain attachments designed to transform the Green Egg into different tools. The Pizza Porta, for example, turns it into the perfect pizza oven.When everything was said and done, Sandie, who had never been to EGGFest before, gave the event a 12 out of 10 rating.You won’t want to miss next year’s EGGFest, which is on the first Friday and Saturday of August in 2018. We hope to see you there.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today we’re at Chik’n Mi restaurant to give you a quick look at our current market.Now that we’re halfway through the year, Sandie and I are here to bring you a look at what’s going on in today’s local market.To do this, we’re going inside the new Chik’n Mi restaurant on 2319 Brownsboro Road. This is a great place to eat with a lot to offer. Sandie and I tried a few things, including beignets with a mango miso sauce,  spicy ramen, and even a chicken and bacon sandwich served with roasted potatoes.The restaurant was created by Jason and Aenith McCullum, who had a dream of bringing great, interesting food to the area. Aenith was born in Laos, a landlocked country in Southeast Asia. She learned traditional recipes from her mother and picked up other culinary influences from other restaurants and also from school.“We didn’t create Korean fried chicken,” she said, “but we did create the sauce.” She and Jason wanted to take what they each knew about food and bring it to the community in a way they knew everyone would love.Back in the realm of real estate, interest rates right now are holding steady. Home sales are down 12.8% for the month of June year over year. Last year was better in this area, but not because people aren’t looking for or can’t afford homes.“NOW IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THEIR NEXT PROPERTY.”Our prediction is that the market will stay in good shape as long as there are homes coming onto it. Homes in the $100,000 and about $400,000 are selling quickly as long as they’re in good conditions and in the right location.If moving up is in your future, there are great deals right now within the $500,000 to $800,000 price range—which is a buyer’s market. These homes are sitting a little longer, so now is a great opportunity for anyone looking for their next property in that range.So if we can help you with any of your real estate needs be sure to check us out.

        "content": "Housing inventory is low across the nation. However, some sellers are missing out on the perfect chance to move up into higher price points.I’m coming to you from New York City, where I shot my new commercial with Barbara Corcoran. I got to chat with some of the top agents in the country, and I’m hearing the same thing over and over: there is a lack of inventory in the market.Even here in Kentucky, inventory is low. Remember, housing inventory is measured by the absorption rate. An absorption rate between five and six months is considered a balanced market, while anything over six months is a buyer’s market and anything under five months is a seller’s market.There are seller’s markets popping up all across the country. Just listen to what these top agents had to say:Amanda Howard from Huntsville, Alabama says her market only has 3.5 months of inventory, while Nick Shivers from Portland says that there are only 1.3 months of inventory available across the board. In fact, some neighborhoods in Portland don’t have any inventory at all.John Modine from Dayton, Ohio, says that while the inner city market is still full of foreclosures, homebuyers in the suburbs are fighting through multiple offers and running out of houses to look at.Curtis Johnson from Phoenix says that some areas have almost no inventory, while others still have some. Marti Hampton from North Carolina says that she has definitely seen low inventory up to certain price points in certain areas. Some neighborhoods start to balance out once they are over $400,000, while others have more inventory in the $600,0000 price range.“NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO BE A MOVE-UP BUYER.”So, why aren’t there enough homes in the $100,000 to $400,000 market? There are a variety of reasons.According to Mark Spain from Atlanta, we went through a period where there was not a lot of new housing stock created because construction costs went up much faster than appreciation. Tiffany Lachnidt from Colorado Springs believes some of the problem is due to a lack of economic confidence.If you are a homeowner in the $100,000 to $400,000 price range, then you really need to listen to Marti Hampton. Marti says that people are simply staying in their homes too long. Right now, sellers in this price range have a great opportunity to sell for top dollar and get a great deal on a home in the $550,000 to $600,000 range.In other words, you have the chance to sell in a seller’s market and buy in a buyer’s market.Now, you can check out the video for a few behind-the-scenes shots of my commercial with Barbara Corcoran. We are glad to be on Barbara’s team, and we would like to be on your team, too.Whether you are looking to buy in a seller’s market or if you plan on moving up to bigger and better things, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "There are many mortgage loan options out there that allow you to put down considerably less than 20%.As we were discussing ways to help our clients at the latest mastermind we’re currently attending in San Diego, a couple of things were brought to my attention about our market back in Louisville.The first is a lack of inventory in the $100,000 to $350,000 price range. The second is a misconception among potential buyers about how much you need to put down to buy a home in the $100,000 to $350,000 range and the ranges above that.How much do you really need to put down in your down payment? **The answer can vary depending on the type of mortgage loan you get. **For FHA loans, there are no income restrictions and you only need to put 3.5% down. Veterans applying for VA loans don’t need to put any money down. Conventional loans require a minimum of 5% down, but you can use lender-paid mortgage insurance to lower your payments and give yourself the opportunity to afford more home. Plus, everything is tax deductible. If you can put 20% down, however, you can’t use private mortgage insurance.“IT’S NOT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT DOWN 20% TO BUY A HOME.”Many people are under the assumption that they need to put down 20%, but that’s only true if you’re buying an investment property, and even that’s not a hard and fast rule. Fannie Mae guidelines have been loosened to the point where you can potentially only put down 15% to buy an investment property.Through the Kentucky Housing Corporation, which provides down payment assistance, Sandie has been able to get her clients homes with no money down. They offer conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, or RHS loans.If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in our Louisville market, don’t hesitate to give me a call. We’d be happy to help you.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What’s the best way to get an accurate home value? Not from Zillow, apparently.If you’ve recently visited Zillow and were shocked at the figure you got from their Zestimate feature, you’re not alone. If you’ve thought about suing Zillow because of this inaccurate information, you’re not alone either.That’s right, there is a woman in Illinois who is suing Zillow because she is having trouble selling her home. My friend Barbara Corcoran was on Good Morning America recently to talk about this topic. You can see her full comments above, but there were a few things she said that stood out to me.“TRUST AN EXPERT’S OPINION ON YOUR HOME VALUE, NOT A WEBSITE’S.”First off, the woman suing Zillow believes her home is worth $626,000, nearly the same price she bought the home for. The Zestimate for her property, however, came in at just $562,000.Zillow has publicly responded to the lawsuit saying, “A Zestimate is as starting point to determine a home’s value, and is not an official appraisal. The plaintiff can update her own Zestimate by adding the square footage of her home.”Is Zillow the best place to start determining your home’s value? This is what Barbara had to say:“Yes it’s a good starting point, but it’s not a reliable figure. If you want to get the best price, or at least an accurate one, you must know the real value of the home by being accurate about what homes are compared to yours and a real estate agent who knows what they are doing.”Essentially, don’t trust Zillow when it comes time to price your home. Trust the expert opinion of a local real estate professional. If you’d like our opinion on your home’s value or if you have any other questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

This 25,000 square foot property is listed at $20 million, and as you can see, you’ve really made it when you can afford to live here.“YOU KNOW YOU’VE MADE IT WHEN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN HOMES LIKE THESE.”The two rooms that really sell homes are kitchens and master bathrooms, and both areas in this house are enormous. On the outside, you’ll find a pool and a walking garden with an overhanging trellis. The garage holds three Ferraris, which unfortunately don’t come with the house.The second home was built in 2007 and is listed at $7.5 million. At 10,000 square feet, my wife describes it as “more welcoming.” From the back of the property, you get a nice snapshot of Camelback Mountain and a faraway view of downtown Phoenix.Whenever I tour homes like these, I feel like Robin Leach from “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.”What about our market back home? The Louisville and southern Indiana market is as hot as we’ve ever seen it. The problem is there isn’t enough inventory, so there’s a strong need for more homes to come on the market. This means now is the time to list your home. If you’re a buyer, we have 18 agents ready and waiting to help you find the home of your dreams.If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call.

We measure the number of homes that are selling by absorption rate, which takes into account our current inventory and the number of recent sales. The figure is a measure of how long it would take all the homes on the market to sell if no other homes came on the market.In some price ranges in our market, basically from $100,000 to $300,000, the absorption rate is down to 1.1 months, putting us in an extremely strong seller’s market. For reference, a balanced market is between four and six months of inventory. Right now, you are able to put your home on the market for a little more money while also being able to sell it within a few weeks, or even within a few days. Homes are moving extremely quickly due to the high number of buyers in the market.“LOUISVILLE REAL ESTATE IS AS HOT AS WE’VE EVER SEEN.”If you’re a buyer in the market who is thinking of moving up, conditions are perfect for you. You can sell your home in a strong seller’s market while buying a home in a higher price range that’s in more of a balanced market. If you’re a buyer who is looking in those hot price ranges, however, I have an extra strategy that might help you out.In this competitive market, we have been using escalation clauses in our offers. We write in the offer that we are willing to increase our offer by $1,000 over the next highest offer up to a certain amount. Without doing anything but putting this clause in our contracts, we can help you make a much stronger offer. This strategy gives you a jump on a lot of buyers out there who have agents who have never even heard of an escalation clause.Keep in mind that there are a few things to be wary of when using this strategy. For one, the home has to appraise or you have to be willing to pay the difference in the appraisal price and the purchase price. Secondly, we are seeing a lot of sellers simply reject lowball offers, even with escalation clauses. Sellers feel insulted when buyers come in too low, even if they write in the offer that they will increase it. Coming in at list price with an escalation clause is your best bet in this type of market climate.If you have any questions for us or want to know more about escalation clauses or what’s happening in the Louisville market, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We would love to hear from you soon.",

        "content": "The Louisville market is red hot right now with high demand from buyers and extremely low inventory. What does this mean to you, though?Today, Sandie and I are out about 35 miles from Las Vegas in majestic Red Rock Canyon for a beautiful backdrop to talk real estate.The Louisville market is red hot right now, but problems remain with buyers not being able to find homes. We track inventory with an absorption rate to determine how many months of supply the market has, with anything above six months said to be a buyer’s market and anything below five months said to be a seller’s market. Five to six months of inventory is said to be a balanced market.As you can see from the slide in the video above, the absorption rate for homes in the $50,000 to $400,000 price range is a little disturbing for homebuyers because there are so few homes available.“INVENTORY IS LOW AND PRICES ARE PROJECTED TO KEEP RISING UNTIL 2021.”In fact, the $150,000 to $200,000 price range has just 1.2 months of inventory. The market is so hot that we’re seeing multiple offers on a home in a single day.On the other hand, there is a 13.4-month supply of homes in the $700,000 and above price range, making it a firm buyer’s market. Home prices have continued to rise over the last year; many areas of Louisville have seen prices increase by 5.47%, bringing home prices just about back to where they were prior to the bubble bursting in 2007.This continues to be a reason homebuyers are clamoring to buy a home now; prices are projected to keep rising until 2021. If you bought a $250,000 home this January, it would be expected to rise in value by $42,898 by 2022. Even though mortgage interest rates rose slightly this month, the projection is still low, so it’s still a perfect time to buy a home.We expect the market to get hotter and hotter throughout 2017. Of course, that depends on what we see from the interest rates, but things are looking good so far.Now back to the beautiful part—Red Rock Canyon. The color of this canyon is something spectacular that we just don’t have back in Louisville. While in Las Vegas, we also got a chance to check out Topgolf. In the video above, you can take a look at my silky smooth golf swing and Sandie’s less successful attempt. The Las Vegas Topgolf is a multi-level facility and it even has a pool with a bar. It’s very impressive.Thanks for joining us today! If you’re thinking about selling your house, now is the time to do it, so give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to helping you!",

        "content": "Why is the Louisville real estate market so competitive right now? Inventory is low and buyer demand is high; I’ll explain what that means for you today.About four weeks ago, I had a quadruple bypass. Even though I am relaxing and taking it easy here in Sarasota, I am still thinking about the Louisville real estate market.Existing home sales are the highest they have been since 2007. In fact, in the Kentucky area, home sales are up 3.6% month over month and 3.1% year over year. As you know, anything between five and six months of inventory is considered a balanced market. If there are more than six months of inventory, then you are in a buyer’s market. With less than five months of inventory, we are in a firm seller’s market.“THE FEAR OF RISING INTEREST RATES IS DRIVING BUYER ACTIVITY.”In fact, if you are looking for a home priced between $100,000 and $300,000, the absorption rate is between one and two months. That is simply unheard of! Now is a great time to sell faster and for more money.Even with amazing buyer demand, a lot of people don’t know that you can buy a home with less than 3% down. Most people think you need 10% to 20% down. Even current homeowners think they need 20% down to move up into a higher price point. Sandie Sokoler has been in the mortgage industry for 40 years and she can tell you that you only need 3% down and a 680 credit score with Fannie Mae.Housing inventory around the country continues to drop. We can expect more homes on the market in April, May, and June, which is peak buyer’s season. If you want to sell your home, now is actually a better time to be on the market because you will have less competition.The fear of rising interest rates is driving buyer activity right now. Rates have come down a bit and they are projected to hover between 4.25% and 4.75% for the remainder of the year.We expect the market to get even hotter as 2017 continues, especially with some of the reforms coming down from Washington. If you are thinking about buying or selling, now is the time to get out there.Before you put your house on the market, send me an email. I will send you a copy of our selling guide called “150 Steps to Selling Faster and for More Money” for free and with no obligation.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I’m here at The Fun Park in Middletown to let you know why right now is the best time to sell your home.If you are looking for something to do during the cold winter days in the Louisville area, the Fun Park in Middletown might be the place for you. I’ll go over what’s going on here at the Fun Park in a second, but for now let’s turn our attention to what’s happening with our real estate market.In the Louisville and southern Indiana area it’s apparent that right now is the best time to list and sell your home. Waiting until spring could be a huge mistake.Part of the reason demand is so high right now is the fact that the housing supply is incredibly low not only in our area, but across the country. Additionally, interest rates are still historically low even after the increase a couple months ago. Rent is also continuing to increase, so people are looking to step into the role of homeownership.The absorption rate is talked about pretty often and includes the amount of inventory on the market, the number of new listings coming on the market, and buyers. Anything more than a six-month supply of homes is said to be a buyer’s market, a five- to six-month supply is a normal market, and anything less than a five-month supply of homes is a seller’s market.If you take a look at the Louisville market, the absorption rate is at a 2.93-month supply, so we are in a very strong seller’s market. If you break down the absorption rate by price range, the majority of homes between $100,000 and $500,000 are in a 1.4 to 2.9 months supply, which is incredible. These numbers are likely sprouting as a result of growing consumer confidence. In fact, according to Bloomberg News, consumer confidence jumped to the highest level since 2004. Additionally, CNBC reported that the percentage of Americans who believe the economy will get better in the next year jumped an unprecedented 17 points to 42%.We are finding an amazing amount of buyers who are sitting and waiting for homes to come on the market. When we list a home, we schedule showings within a matter of hours because there are so many people looking for homes. So if you want to maximize the amount of money you can get for you home and sell it quickly, now is the time to give us a call.Now, let’s shift back to where I am, The Fun Park in Middletown. It doesn’t matter if you’re a kid or a kid at heart, there is something here for everyone. There are lots of games for kids, but adults can look forward to laser tag and a number of other things to do while spending a cold day inside.“WE ARE FINDING AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF BUYERS WHO ARE SITTING AND WAITING FOR HOMES TO COME ON THE MARKET.”The Fun Park in Middletown has some great packages that you can buy as well. Those packages accommodate both people who want to spend a few hours there and those who want to spend a whole day there. Also, when it gets warm out, putt-putt golf and go-carts are added to the fun things to do here!If you want any more information about buying or selling a home, we are here for you 24/7. If you’d like our free booklet on selling your home faster and for more money, send me an email. You can also give me a call if you have any questions or would like a free consultation.

        "content": "Today I’m speaking with an expert to inform you of what to expect from interest rates in 2017.It’s finally 2017, and one thing a lot of people are keeping an eye on is interest rates and how they will affect our real estate market. With that in mind, today I’m speaking with Jeff Ratanapool from Century Mortgage to get his perspective on this topic.Jeff has an excellent record of predicting all things real estate. Over the past year, he’s made a dozen major predictions and only misfired on one of them. Regarding interest rates, he predicted they would drop for a little while and then come back up again and end around 4.25%, which is almost exactly what happened.For 2017, from the standpoint of interest rates, Jeff notes that there is a lot of uncertainty because of the new presidential administration. There is also a lot of hope, though, because there should be some regulatory relief across all channels of business. This could mean that lending restrictions will loosen and allow for more people to get financed.Jeff is excited about the number of people who could buy homes. The uncertainty in the financial markets will likely cause rates to inch upward, but not by a large margin. According to him, **we should stay in the 4% to 4.5% range, and may even dip below 4%, depending on what else happens globally. **Overall, Jeff foresees a great year of volume and financing, and possibly the start of many great years to come.If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, now is the perfect time to give us a call.

        "title": "A Special Market Update from Cancun",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "This market update is coming to you from a resort in Cancun, where we are taking a few moments to enjoy ourselves. I’ve been accused in the past of not taking time to relax and enjoy life, so I’m doing exactly that. Before I get to what else I’m doing here in Cancun, let’s talk about something more important: the current state of the Louisville real estate market.Home sales in Louisville are doing very well. They are up 4.6% compared to November of 2015. The number of homes going under contract is also up 8.3% from 2015. However, here’s the problem. The number of listings on the market, as of last month, is down 22.2% from last year. That’s a problem because buyers can’t find homes.Since 2011, inventory has dropped dramatically, bottoming out in January of last year. We expect January of 2017 to bring an even lower level of inventory. If you’ve been thinking of selling, this may be the perfect time. With the supply and demand where it’s at right now, you’re not likely to get a much better deal any time soon.“SELLERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE CONDITIONS.”We just started tracking homes by price range, and according to the latest market report., the absorption rate (a measure of inventory) is different for each price range. It’s low in the lower price ranges, but as you move up into the $500,000 and above range, the inventory skyrockets. The buyer traffic is there, but the inventory just isn’t. This is probably part of the reason we have seen interest rates start to tick up slightly. According to the experts, rates are expected to rise a bit more through 2017, hovering in the 4.2 to 4.4 range.So, back to Cancun. We are here at a mastermind conference with some great agents from around the country and our friends at Vyral Marketing. Vyral and their CEO. Frank Klesitz did a great job setting this up. We were able to pick some of the brains of the top people in this business and have a good time doing it. Our excursions included scuba diving in the second largest barrier reef in the world, exploring an underwater cave, and seeing ancient Mayan architecture. Check out some of the places we visited in our video above.If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy or sell in Louisville, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

His date to the Derby is someone you will probably recognize!In the interview, Trump says that he was visiting the “beautiful” Churchill Downs because a friend of his had a horse racing in the Kentucky Derby. When I asked whether he’d be interested in investing in horse racing, he responded that he didn’t think so because it would be “A very full-time kind of a thing.”I don’t clearly remember all of the details of the interview at the time, looking back, the obvious question I wish I would have asked him was, “Would you ever consider running for president?”",
