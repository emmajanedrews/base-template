        "author": "",

        "content": "What is driving the massive growth in Las Vegas? Today, I have three reasons that contribute.&nbsp;Forbes magazine just recently announced America’s fastest-growing cities in 2018. Las Vegas was one of the top cities in the country in terms of projected aggressive growth.What is driving this growth?  One of the reasons that Las Vegas’ cost of living is still very low compared to the rest of the country is that real estate prices are still 25% to 30% below the peak of where they once were. This has caused an influx of people moving to the area.  Many people who once lived in Vegas unfortunately lost their houses due to foreclosure short sale bankruptcy when the market collapsed. Those people are back on the market now that they’ve fixed their credit, so they’re ready to buy again. This means there’s been an increase in demand from buyers that were renting at one point. This also encourages a lot of new home construction.  Additionally, there are a lot of jobs that are being created by the construction field. Recently, a new Raiders stadium began construction, as well as a practice facility that will be built in Henderson. There are also a couple major casinos that will begin construction soon.“There are a lot of jobs that are being created by the construction field.”If you have any questions about what Las Vegas’ recent growth means for you or you are looking to buy or sell real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Waiting around for a market correction is rarely a good reason to keep renting. The longer you wait, the more money you are putting toward someone else’s mortgage instead of your own.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report.Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale.Is it better to buy right away or rent until there’s a market correction? The truth is that it depends on your circumstances.To help you determine what’s right for you, there are a couple of things you should ask yourself. First, how long are you looking to rent for? If the period of time is short, it’s a good idea to rent. This is especially true if you are only looking for temporary housing.If you’re only looking to rent because you want to wait for prices to correct themselves in the market, there are a few statistics you should be aware of.The average rent of a small home is $1,500. If you pay this amount each month for a full year, this would amount to $18,000.“THE LONGER YOU WAIT, THE LONGER YOU’RE PUTTING OFF HAVING A PAID-OFF HOME OF YOUR OWN.”If you’re waiting around for the market to correct itself, you are throwing away a lot of money. Over the course of three years, a monthly rent of $1,500 would amount to $54,000. Why help someone else pay off their mortgage when the money could go towards your own?A typical mortgage will be paid off within 30 years. The longer you wait, the longer you’re putting off having a paid-off home of your own.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Many people believe that it takes a lot of money down to be able to afford a home. With the help of down payment assistance programs, this isn’t always the case.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report.Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale.Today I’ve got some exciting news. If you’ve been renting because you believe you don’t have enough money for a down payment, you should know that you actually have some options.It is a common misconception that to buy a home you need to come up with a large sum for the down payment. This is not always the case.There are a number of programs out there allow you to purchase a home for very little money down.To discuss this, I recently sat down with one of the top loan officers in Las Vegas: Monica Aldana from Cross Country Mortgage.With a conventional loan, you can put just 3%, 4%, or 5% down so long as your credit score is above 640.You also never have to repay the money you receive from this assistance program. However, there is a fee of approximately $700 for down payment assistance.“THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE A HOME FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY DOWN.”If you have credit score of at least 660 and are using the FHA loan, you can qualify to put down 4% through that program. Typically, though, buyers can qualify for just 3.5% down using an FHA loan. This means that money saved on the down payment could go toward closing costs.Programs like these open up a lot of opportunities. However, there are some things you should be aware of.It’s also important to remember that interest rates are higher for these programs than what is found on the standard market. However, these interest rates are not FICO-driven.This means that if you have a low FICO score, you could get a lower interest rate by using a down payment assistance program.If you’ve got any questions for Monica about this, you can reach her by calling (702) 339-8221.Also, if you would like more information or have any other questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

In fact, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.The answer to this question depends on your personal circumstances. To determine what is right for you, you should consider two main factors.“THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL ANSWER.”First of all, think about your own motivation and need to sell. Why do you want to sell? Do you need to sell first to buy another property?Next, consider price. Pricing a home correctly is absolutely critical to getting top dollar. Future appreciation aside, you can still get a great price now if you understand how to properly price your home.Another thing you might want to consider is the option of renting your property out. If you’re waiting to see where the market goes, why not rent out the property and make some money in the meantime?If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

With many more buyers than sellers, what’s the best way for a buyer to prepare to get the home they want? According to Monica, it’s getting a pre-approval. Don’t settle for a quick pre-qualification. A fully underwritten approval with verified income and assets is what you’re looking for. It only takes a few days, and then you can go home shopping with confidence.“A FULLY UNDERWRITTEN PRE-APPROVAL IS KEY.”If you’re a seller in this market, Monica says not to accept an offer from a buyer who doesn’t have a fully underwritten approval because they might not actually be able to buy your home.

If you missed the first part of our discussion, you can see it here.Inventory is low across the country and Las Vegas is no different. We have just 4,917 single-family houses for sale in the Las Vegas area. That might not sound like a shortage, but compared to the nearly 8,000 houses we had for sale at this time last year, you can see how drastically inventory has shrunk.There are also just 366 condominiums and 305 townhomes for sale in our market. When you buy a home in our market, you need to be aggressive. You can win in this low inventory market by following a few key tips:1. Don’t overanalyze the process: Be aggressive and don’t take too long looking for options because you just won’t have many options.2. Be prepared for a bidding war: There will be a lot of buyers looking for homes that are priced right and in good condition, so put your best foot forward.“YOU DON’T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME IF YOU FIND A HOME YOU LIKE.”3. Listen to your agent: Learn from other buyers’ mistakes.

How do you know which agent is the best one for the job? Here are a few tips:1. Work with an agent who specializes in selling houses. Don’t work with a buyer’s agent. Listing agents are experienced in negotiating with buyers. They know what to do to sell your home and will give you the best advice to help you move forward, avoid surprises, and net the most money.2. You should hire an active agent. Over 80% of agents only sell four properties a year. They are not actively working in the real estate industry every day to sell homes.“HIRE A LISTING AGENT WHO IS ACTIVE IN THE MARKET EVERY DAY.”3. Ask how much experience they have. You need an experienced agent who has seen both the peak and the lowest point of the market. They will know how to handle every situation that may arise during the transaction. Keep in mind that some experienced agents only do four deals a year, so ask how many transactions they do as well.4. Ask for references. Ask the agent for three or four references. Check their past sales on Zillow and other review sites to make sure that you hire a good listing agent.Keep these four things in mind when hiring a listing agent and you will hire the right one for the job.

They only look at the most recent sales within the area.“IF YOUR HOME’S APPRAISAL COMES IN LOW, YOU HAVE THREE OPTIONS.”As a home seller, you have three options:1. We ask the buyer to come up with the difference in cash out of pocket. This is ideal for the seller because it keeps the deal together and gets you the same amount of money as you expected from the beginning.2. The seller can lower the sales price to the appraised value. In this case, you will net less money, but if you’re really motivated to keep a deal together and move, this might be the best solution.3. We can renegotiate the deal and meet the buyer halfway. Meeting halfway means the buyer will come up with some cash for the difference and the seller brings the sales price down a bit. We can also renegotiate to have the buyer pay some or all of the closing costs.If you’re thinking about selling your house and you’d like to know what it’s worth in today’s market, give me a call or send me an email.

Looking back at the history of real estate in our country, though, five-year growth periods tend to be followed by a market correction or slowdown. I don’t expect our market to depreciate, but I do expect some kind of slowdown based on the supply and demand.Houses listed above the $300,000 to $400,000 range should be the price bracket most directly affected by this slowdown. As the number of buyers in this area decreases, the number of sellers should increase because of the overall appreciation and a better opportunity to sell those kinds of homes. There aren’t a lot of buyers out there who can qualify for that kind of loan, so if you’re selling your home above this price bracket, I would be very aggressive with pricing it before the competition increases.“OVERALL, THINGS ARE LOOKING POSITIVE.”If your house is worth less than $280,000, that’s a great place to be, because that’s the maximum mortgage amount the majority of home buyers can qualify for here in Las Vegas.

There are five big advantages to home sellers when it comes to listing your home during the holidays:“A MORE EMOTIONAL BUYER IS A QUICKER BUYER.”  Buyers who are looking to buy a property during the holidays are far more serious about making a purchase. They won’t waste a minute of your time, and they won’t hesitate to pull the trigger if they like your home.  Buyers have more time to search for homes. All the time off they get from work will give them more hours in the day to peruse the market.  The number of listing increases dramatically after the holidays. This means if you follow suit, your house might be swallowed up by the competition.  Houses always show better during the holidays. All houses look better when they’re decorated for the holidays.  The season makes buyers more emotional. A more emotional buyer is a quicker buyer.If you have any questions or are thinking about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me so we can set up a free consultation.
