        "content": "While the rest of the country is still dealing with the tail end ofwinter, right now in Arizona we’re in our prime home selling season.Here in Tucson in particular, February through June are our strongestmonths. If you’re a seller, how can you maximize your sale price whileminimizing your costs? Let’s start with maximizing your sale price. Your home must give astrong first impression, and that first impression starts outside onthe street where people pull up in their cars. The front yardlandscaping, the front entry, and your home’s exterior painting allcontribute significantly to your home’s curb appeal. Once you get inside the house, the carpeting, flooring, and windows allneed to be clean. Layer on a fresh coat of paint if possible. Makingthese areas look spotless might seem like a nuisance, but doing it willhelp your house sell quicker. The earlier a house sells in its listingperiod, the higher the price it generally sells for. What about minimizing your costs? Not many sellers do this, but werecommend getting your home inspected. Have a home inspector gothrough your home with a fine-toothed comb so you can repair any itemswith a vendor of your choice. You lose a lot of cost control if you letthe buyer do their own inspection after you’re under contract and selectwhich vendors to use.Whether you’re a buyer or a seller looking to make a move in our market,please give us a call so we can help you out. We look forward to hearingfrom you!looking to make a move in our market, please give us a call so we canhelp you out. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "title": "How Has the Election Impacted the Tucson Market?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’m discussing the post-election market in Tucson and what things look like going forward for buyers and sellers. As many of you are aware, interest rates were slightly over 3% in the last quarter of 2016. Since then, they have shot up to as high as 4.5%. That swing is certainly affecting buyers because it’s making homes more expensive and forcing buyers to come down from their previous purchase prices a little bit.There are a few factors that you need to consider if you’re buying or selling in Tucson. One of these is the abundance of new construction in town. We’ve had virtually no new construction here since 2007, so there’s pent-up demand for new homes.If you’re a seller, you need to be cognizant of new construction in your area because of how it could affect your home sale. If you’re selling under $300,000 however, you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much. Home sales are up 12% over a year ago and inventory is down 28%. This puts you in a strong seller’s market. Homes in this range are selling quickly and very close to, if not over, list price. Some homes are even getting multiple offers.If you’re buying in this market, you need to be prepared to move and move quickly on a desirable property. However, it might take losing a few properties to get the right one, so be cognizant of that as well.If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling in Tucson, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "title": "Calling All Renters &amp; Investors in Tucson",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I’d like to take this chance to reach out to potential investors and renters to talk a bit about the Tucson market and how it may affect you.First, let me point out that rental rates are rising two to three times faster than the appreciation of new homes. If you’re a renter, you already know this, because you’re probably seeing your rent go up.Here in Tucson, our average sale price for a home is $217,000, which is pretty competitive as far as the country goes. If you pay $1,300 to $1,400 a month in rent, you can actually buy an average-priced home in the Tucson market for the same amount. Interest rates are still very low, but they will start to inch up as the economy improves.If you’re a renter getting pushed around with rent and you’re thinking about buying a home, talk to a lender and seriously take a look at what you could buy for the same amount of money you pay every month in rent. Then, you could have the additional tax write-offs at the end of the year that you don’t get as a renter.As for investors, now is a good time to start looking at properties. Prices are going up and inventory is going down, so it’s getting a little more complicated. The point is that the return on investment today in the Tucson market for investors buying a rental property is probably higher than it’s been in the last couple decades.If you’re a renter or an investor looking to buy a property, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I’d be glad to help you in any way that I can.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Now that 2017 is underway, I wanted to bring you a quick update on the Tucson real estate market.As it turned out, 2016 was actually a great rebuilding year. Our average list price is up about 4% and our average unit sales are up about 3% from last year. Things are looking pretty positive, and we are still in a recovering economy, which means the market is recovering as well.On the other hand, we have seen a large decrease in inventory. The active listings in the MLS are down to about 4,000, which is a 20% decrease from last year. As supply goes down, prices go up, which means we should see continued upward movement in prices in 2017. This is great news for sellers, but buyers need to be prepared to move fairly quickly to purchase a property.Last year, our average days on market was 60, and today it’s 47. Homes that are in the right areas and priced right are selling very quickly. In fact, 68% of our sales happen in the first 60 days. If you are looking to buy, make sure you have met with your lender and are ready to jump on a property.2017 is going to be a great year for real estate based on a few things that are happening here in Tucson. Raytheon, one of our largest employers, just got a $2 billion government contract and will be hiring somewhere close to 2,000 people over the next couple of years. Caterpillar, from Peoria, Illinois, is moving some of their management level people here. The University of Arizona will be opening a graduate veterinary school in Oro Valley which will bring in 500 students initially, then grow to 800. Roche Medical is also continuing to expand. All of these factors will be great for our market growth.If you are looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

Rental rates are skyrocketing right now, so we are going to talk you through a few statistics when it comes to renting vs. buying.The median sale price last month in Tucson was $173,000. If you were to buy that house with 10% down, your monthly payment would be right around $900. If you were to rent that same house today, your payment would be around $1,360 per month.As you can see, you are paying a premium for renting. I strongly suggest that renters reach out to a real estate professional or a lending professional and have them explain the details to you. I’m sure you will find that buying is in your best interest.I suggest you talk to someone soon. Interest rates are still at record lows but housing prices are starting to inch back up as the market recovers. It’s a great time to take a serious look at becoming a homeowner, no matter what your situation.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you make an offer on a home in Arizona, you will present a home seller with our residential purchase contract. The primary point to that offer is what you are physically offering – the financial side of things.This includes your down payment, your earnest money, and your pre-approval if you’re buying with financing. We put all of this together and submit an offer so it’s taken seriously. The purchase contract contains three contingencies, which are in there to protect you as a buyer.The first contingency is the inspection period, which gives you 10 days to order and complete any inspections on the home that you choose. We then send the inspection report to the seller with a list of items that we want them to repair. If they don’t respond in the way you want or you can’t come to an agreement, you are then free to cancel the contract. At the same time, we use a title company to make sure the home will be easily transferable if you choose to proceed.If you and the seller come to an agreement on the repairs, it’s time to move on to the next contingency – the appraisal contingency. Your lender is going to order the appraisal for an appraiser to come up and inspect the property and confirm the property is worth what the offer is. This ensures you don’t overpay.The final contingency is the loan contingency. Through the entire process, the lender is going to give the seller updates on how the loan is proceeding. If something were to happen in the middle of the transaction that resulted in you not being able to afford the home, you won’t be forced to buy the property.If you manage the transaction properly, your earnest money is never at risk. We have never lost a penny of clients’ earnest money in 16 years and we don’t plan on starting now.If you have any questions for us or would like to take a look at a copy of our purchase contract, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "I wanted to revisit the topic of mortgages so that buyers have an idea of what to expect in today’s market.The Dodd-Frank Act brought a lot of changes to the mortgage industry in the last couple of years, and most of them were implemented this year. This affects you, the consumer, in terms of the time it takes to close a home loan. Before the act, a mortgage usually took about 20 to 30 days to close, whereas today, it’s closer to 30 to 45 days. Some of the government-backed loans like VA loans or FHA loans are stretching out even longer.If you’re a buyer, you’ll want to get your lending issues resolved as early in the process as you can so your lender can move quickly once you go under contract. On the seller side, you can also expect delays. Typically, agents write contracts with a 30- to-45 day closing, and if the lender runs into any difficulties getting it approved, we end up having to push them out a bit.Make sure you coordinate with your agent so that neither of you encounters any surprises like having to move out of the house earlier or later than you originally thought.Another issue in the mortgage world that’s affecting both buyers and sellers is appraisals. With new government regulations, lenders don’t reach out directly to appraisers anymore; instead, they go through a central clearing house so that the lender can’t affect the results of the appraisal.Appraisers are backed up as well. Normally, they have a 10-day window from the time they’re ordered to respond back with the appraisal. With the volume of activity we’re having right now, the appraisers are also backlogged. That 10-day period is now closer to a 12- to 15-day norm.If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home or you have any questions about mortgages and how they’ve changed, give us a call. We’d be happy to help you in any way we can.",

However, some properties have evaporative cooling in addition to regular air conditioning.What is evaporative cooling? Evaporative cooling dumps a high volume of moist air into the house. Since our area has low relative humidity, the moist air evaporates and cools the home. You don’t see this in other parts of the country because our area is so dry.Evaporative cooling can save you a lot of money on utilities. In fact, you can run an evaporative cooling unit at 25% of the cost of a standard AC unit. The downside is that once monsoon season starts in July, our humidity goes up and evaporative cooling doesn’t work as well.However, you can still use evaporative cooling during the first half of the summer. When monsoon season hits, you can use your regular air conditioner.If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

We go from 100% to about 80% to 85%. It’s still possible to sell in this market, but only if you approach it the right way. That means avoiding overpricing.First of all, buyers who are shopping are studying all the inventory on the market, and if you overprice, they’ll know you’re overpriced. This will cause them to skip over your home and not even look at it until you make price reductions to bring it down to market value.Secondly, by overpricing, you are going to make your competition look more attractive. Buyers will perceive the competition as a better value, and they will be more interested in those homes. As always, it’s important to price your home right at market value and not a penny higher. You’re better off pricing it there and letting us do the negotiation for you.If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving us a call or sending us an email.

Today we’ll talk briefly about these contingencies.The inspection contingency is important, and I would recommend an inspection every time that you buy or sell a home. In Arizona, sellers will provide you with a seller’s disclosure statement, but that is just the seller’s opinion of the home.The appraisal contingency is another major one. This is not required if you’re paying cash, but the bank will always want to run an appraisal to ensure that they’re not lending you too much money. This is kind of a safety net to ensure that you don’t overpay for a home.The loan contingency is important because it protects buyers in the case that they are not able to proceed with a loan. If a buyer loses a job, suffers from a medical attack, or any other cataclysmic event occurs, the buyer is protected.These are three ways that buyers are protected when they purchase a home in Arizona.

Homes are going to sell in this time frame and if yours isn’t on the market, you won’t be able to capture those buyers.Many people do wait until after the holidays to list their homes. January is the #1 month in Tucson for new listings on the market. It can be very easy for your home to get lost in the shuffle when there are over 1,000 homes coming on the market. Listing it now means your home will sell faster and stand out more to buyers.The people that are out looking for a home to purchase during the holidays are usually highly motivated buyers, otherwise they wouldn’t be out looking until all the homes come on the market in January.If you have any questions for us at all, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!",

        "content": "As the year comes to a close, we thought we would share a recap of what we saw in Tucson real estate over the last year.This last year was a fantastic one for real estate in Tucson and the surrounding areas. The average sales price jumped 7.8% since 2013, which makes it three consecutive years of strong appreciation. Currently, our average sales price is $207,000, while the total units sold are slightly off last years pace.The average days on market is as low as it has been all year at 58 days. This is up from the 51 days it typically took to sell a home in 2013. Currently, our inventory in the MLS has 5,800 units, and we’re selling anywhere from 1,200 to 1,300 a month, which means we have less than six months of supply. This means most areas of town have a fairly balanced at this time.Where is the market and where is it going?An interesting data point in our market has to do with how quickly homes are selling. Two-thirds of our sales every month are houses that have been on the market for less than 60 days. Essentially, if homes are priced right, in good condition, and in a good location, they are turning in 60 days.As you can see, we saw a very active and robust market in 2014. But what can we expect in 2015? We’re expecting prices to continue appreciating, although softening slightly compared to the rates we’ve seen in the past few years. Across the city, you can probably expect a 3% to 5% price increase across the city. As far as interest rates go, we’re expecting upward pressure on interest rates in the coming year.If you’re a buyer, it would probably be smart to buy sooner than later. If you’re getting a mortgage, the cost of money and the price of the house are going to rise. If you’re a seller, there are very specific areas of town that are experiencing favorable conditions, while there are other areas that aren’t. It’s best to speak with a real estate expert if you’re thinking about selling, as they will be able to tell you what’s best given your specific circumstances.Have questions about conditions in your area?

        "content": "There are a few things almost all buyers resist: coming to meet us in our office so we can figure out the specifics of the property they are looking for, and meeting with a lender at the front end of the process instead of waiting. Today, we explain why doing both of those things are actually beneficial for all parties involved.Sitting down with a real estate professional will save you time and frustration in the long run. Why? For one, you can save a lot of time by hashing out exactly what you require a home to have and what needs you want met. An agent will show you only homes that satisfy the requirement you laid out, so you don’t have to waste time seeing homes you have no interest in buying. The initial interview is crucial if you want to save time and stress.Talking with a lender is also a crucial part of the process that buyers would rather put off. However, we have had buyers who loved a home they saw, went to get approved by a lender, but were unable to purchase the home once they were approved because someone else had already gotten to it. When you have approval up front, we can act quickly to get the home you like under contract and negotiate a very good deal for you.As you can see, sitting down with an agent and seeing a lender before jumping headfirst into the buying process can be incredibly beneficial.

They submitted an offer with everything that’s needed in our Tuscon market and gave it to the listing agent. The listing agent responded by telling us the seller didn’t want to entertain any contingency offers. Our offer was contingent on the closing - our client already had their house under contract, had the inspections and appraisals completed, but was simply waiting for the official close.We had to explain to the listing agent that over 70% of the buyers in the market have contingencies of some sort - they need to get equity out of an existing property in order to make their next purchase. That’s why, when you’re selling, you should expect certain contingencies when you receive an offer. The important thing is to separate the offers that have inconvenient contingencies from those that have minor ones.

        "content": "Just about everyone we work will bring up their home value according to what their “zestimate” was. Zillow gathers certain data from the local market and plugs it into an algorithm designed to establish a value for your home. The site is good for establishing a ballpark estimate and informing consumers where the market is heading - but not much else.Zillow doesn’t service customers very well when it comes to supply and demand. For homes under $275,000 in Tucson, we currently have a strong seller’s market, with less than a 3-month supply in most areas. On the other hand, the $700,000 and above range is seeing a strong buyer’s market, with an inventory of over 12 months. These differing markets have a huge effect on pricing, and Zillow doesn’t take the variables into account.Another way Zillow fails to assist the consumers is its inattention to the location of properties. Some neighborhoods demand much higher prices than surrounding areas. For instance, we just listed and sold a home with a $300,000 “zestimate” in three months and for just under $600,000. Zillow fails to take location and home improvements into account, which may lead them to undervalue your home.As real estate professionals, it’s our responsibility to get you the highest possible dollar amount for your home.

The amount of available inventory is at 6 months, which is always a good sign heading into the fall months.If you’re pricing your home at $250,000 or less, it’s a very hot market - as many buyers are looking to purchase property in that range. If you’re in the $250,000-$500,000 price range, you’re in a pretty average market - as homes are sitting on the market for about 65-75 days. The luxury market is fairly slow at the moment; we have a growing number of homes on the market that aren’t getting absorbed - but this is dependent on the area.Rates are still very competitive, which is a great sign for buyers. Interest rates are just over 4%, which is about as low as they’re likely to get. In fact, many experts are thinking rates are going to jump soon. Now might be the time to make your move in the Tuscon area because home prices are inching up and rates are likely to rise within the next year.Conditions also look good if you are looking to sell. In the last 24 months home prices have increased 14% and we can expect a rise of 3% to 5% this year. If you price your home competitively, perhaps a little under the market value, you are likely to get a great value for your home in this market.Since real estate is local, conditions may be slightly different in your area.
