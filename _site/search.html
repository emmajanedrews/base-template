They do open houses, knock on doors, make cold calls, and call expired listings and for sale by owner properties. They go out and find the business.Most top agents focus on marketing. Typically 80% or more of a top agent’s business comes from marketing. They get past clients, repeat business, and referrals.What do they do to market? I have the answer here.“Top agents focus on marketing.”In our Business By the Book class, we teach the top marketing and prospecting techniques to help you grow your business.

The most common of these behavioral assessments is one called the DiSC profile, and the big mistake a lot of people make is going to Tony Robbins’ free website and using the free DiSC profile offered there.The problem is, that particular behavioral assessment is geared towards a person who is in their personal and home life, so the results you get from it can vary wildly from something you’d get from a paid Abelson DiSC that costs anywhere from $10 to $20 per report.Dr. Abelson has a great DiSC report that’s entirely based on a person’s job world, and it provides much more clarity for the hiring process. Beyond that, we see people also use things like activity vector assessments from corporate consulting that cost $250 each.“This the only assessment that analyzes cognitive abilities as well as behavior.”At Keller Williams, we’ve built our own proprietary tool that our agents have access to called the Keller Personality Assessment. This is the only one that actually gauges not only what a person’s natural behavioral style is, but it also talks a little bit about their cognitive abilities by checking things like IQ and how quickly they pick up on new things.We’re very excited to be able to offer this to our agents. For a limited time only, you can click here and submit the form and we will send you a link where you can complete the KPA. We’ll then sit down with you and talk about what your strengths are and how you can leverage them to be a great real estate agent.If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "The San Diego County market is suffering from an inventory crisis. However, the best agents are turning this into an opportunity for more business.Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.The latest numbers are in for San Diego County, so I wanted to take a moment to talk about the real estate market and what I’m seeing right now.We’re down about 9% in the number of new listings from last year. We’ve only brought about 12,000 homes on the market this year compared to 14,000 last year. The pace of sales is slowing down a bit too. We saw 7,400 home sales by this time last year, but right now we’re sitting at around 7,300.Combined, those two factors are really knocking down inventory in the market just as the busy season is starting. That’s going to make prices shoot up. Who knew that San Diego County could get more expensive to live in, right?Our median sale price is up by another 5.5% from last year and sits at $510,000, which is absolutely incredible. Half of the home sales are below $510,000, but the other half are above that number. That’s a higher figure than we saw in 2006.“There are only 1.6 months of available inventory right now.”The big question looming for Southern California is what will happen with our active inventory. We’re down by 30% year-over-year.As of April 1st, we had 4,864 properties listed for sale in the entire county, a 1.6 month supply. We typically sell about 3,700 homes each month and that number can rise as high as 5,000 in the summer.Buyers face a scary proposition in this market. When you consider that half of buyers are also sellers, the inventory problem makes sense. Sellers are hesitant because it’s hard for them to answer the question of where they are moving next in this kind of market. That’s where the best agents are turning this market into an opportunity.Next time, I’ll talk about how you can turn these market conditions into a big opportunity for your business. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Any time you tie two transactions together, you put yourself at risk for an antitrust violation.“This can put you at serious risk for antitrust violations.”The biggest instance where this can show up for agents is when an agent takes a listing and the buyer says ‘If I sell this house with you and buy the next one, will you give me a discount?’ Agents can’t sell a house for a client and buy the next one with them at a discount.It’s a tying arrangement and it just can’t be done.

        "content": "Price reductions are never ideal. However, we have a good strategy to share for how to approach them.Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.No seller likes to have to make price reductions, but sometimes they are necessary. How do you determine when your seller needs a price reduction?Today, there are fewer than 5,000 homes on the market in San Diego and in any typical month we sell between 3,000 and 4,000 homes. If your home has been on the market for weeks or months without accepting an offer, it’s time for a price reduction. Homes priced correctly are selling very quickly in today’s market, within days and weeks.The best time to set the stage for this is during the listing consultation with the seller. This way, they can clearly understand the dynamics of today’s market. If we are on the market for more than two weeks and have had fewer than 10 showings and no offers in that time frame, we need to start entertaining the idea of a price reduction.“The best time to set the stage for this is during the listing consultation.”The key to getting the highest price when reducing your price will be to cut fast and cut hard so you get the property under contract quickly.The longer a home sits on the market, the lower the seller’s net is. Sometimes getting the highest possible price for a property requires being brutally honest. If a home has been on the market and is not receiving offers, we call our sellers and let them know the situation.If the market has spoken and the price is too high, we have two options for a reduction. One is a big 10% price reduction to sell quickly or a 5% reduction to test the waters further.At this point, it’s not even an opinion that the home is overpriced, it’s a fact. If you have any questions for us about price reductions or anything else, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "We’re heading toward a market shift, so pricing a home properly is going to be a more important skill now that it has been in the last 10 years. How do you help your sellers do this?Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.I wanted to give you some advice on helping your sellers choose the right price for their homes.As we go into this shifting market, pricing a home is going to be a more in-demand skill than it has been in the last 10 years. As we come into the fourth quarter of 2016, we’re starting to see that the homes that aren’t priced exactly right are sitting on the market. In fact, a lot of them end up having multiple price reductions and selling for less than they probably should have right out of the gate.When you’re helping your seller choose the right price, here’s the simple formula for me: I want to get real about the condition of the property I’m about to bring to market. Is it a two or is it a 10? From there, I want to get real about the condition of the other properties on the market. Are they nicer, or is your seller’s property nicer?Once I’ve identified that, then I’m going to look at the competition and the way they are priced. I intend to be the best, highest quality home on the market for the price. What I’m saying is that if you’re the best value on the market, you’ll always be the first to sell.As somebody who has sold dozens of properties of my own and thousands for other people, I can tell you unequivocally that the market does not let properties sell too cheaply. Here’s what I mean by that–if you think a property is worth somewhere between $450,000 and $500,000, I’m listing it at $450,000 every time. If I list at that price and it was supposed to be $500,000, I’m going to get multiple offers in a short time and it’s going to sell for $500,000 or maybe even more.“The free market will always help you find the right price.”That’s the beauty of the free market system; the market always helps you get the pricing right. It also punishes you when you get greedy on the front end.If the property is worth $500,000 and you price it at $510,000, the property begins to stagnate on the market, you have a low number of showings, and buyers start to wonder what’s wrong with the property. Other agents may not show it, and it eventually sells for far less than it should.Do the right thing by helping your sellers pick the right price out of the gate and get the home sold quickly. If you have any more questions about pricing homes or I can help you in any way with your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!",

You need to be prepared to help them pick the best offer for their unique situation.Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.Inventory is at an all-time low, and if you have a property that is priced right, you should be concerned if you’re not getting multiple offers. As a listing agent, it is your job to help your sellers choose the best offer.Is the best offer always the highest price? Or is a cash offer the best offer? Should you go with a buyer with conventional financing or a buyer with a VA loan?The best offer can actually be any of the above. Ultimately, the best offer is the one that makes the most sense for your seller and is the most likely to close in the time frame your seller wants.Let me give you an example. One of our agents recently sold a great house. An offer came in over asking price — in fact, it was so far over asking that we knew there would be an issue with the appraisal. The agent asked the buyer to add a clause that stated if the appraisal came in up to $25,000 under the offer price, the buyer would write a check for the difference.“As a listing agent, it is your job to help your sellers choose the best offer in a multiple offer situation.”The buyer agreed to the clause up front and we went to get the okay from the lender. We needed to verify that the buyer had the funds to cover the difference and that the loan program would allow them to do so. In this instance, the buyer didn’t have the funds, so we took an offer that was a little bit less money but more able to close.As the listing agent, our job is to fully educate the seller and help them see the upcoming bumps in the road that they might otherwise miss.If you have any questions about dealing with multiple offers or if there is anything else you want to know about, give me a call or send me an email.

Generally, homes are selling over 20% faster than they were last year. Based on that, you’d expect prices to be going on a straight vertical climb. The reality, though, is that they’re only up 2%.“If I’m a seller holding on to a property, I’m listing that property now.”When we look at this trend and factor in interest rates being almost a full 0.75% lower, that means buyers have about 7.5% more purchasing power today than they did a year ago, and they’re only choosing to use 2.9% of that. This tells us that we may be right at the top of a market shift.If I’m a seller holding on to a property that I want to get top dollar for, I’m listing that property now. Not tomorrow — right now.

Why do I need to hire you if I can just use the internet and sites like Zillow to buy and sell homes?”If you run into this situation, here’s what you have to do. You have to help them see it from a perspective that they can relate to. Let’s say the person asking you this question is a doctor. A good answer would be something like this. “As a physician, why would I need you? I can go to WebMD, figure out what kind of prescription I might need, go down to Mexico and get it, and medicate myself.”“You’ve got to appeal to their professional side.”Maybe it’s because there is a chance things could go wrong. Something bad could happen, and you could get really sick by trying to save a few bucks. Things can go wrong in the real estate transaction the same way.
