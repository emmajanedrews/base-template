Here’s what we recommend.* **[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) One of the most common questions we get from homeowners is if they have to allow pets in their rental home.

Getting a property condition form filled out correctly is one of the biggest problems I face in my business. The standard property condition form is four pages and it's very extensive. We require tenants to fill out this form on their way in within the first 10 days of living in a unit. We then go back in on a 10-day walkthrough to remove your lock box and collect the property condition form. During that time, we walkthrough each item on the form that's listed as damaged or not working properly.

If we commit to the repairs during the 10-day walkthrough, they'll be repaired at the owner's cost. ## Wear and tear means things like scratches and scuff marks on the stairs, walls, and bathtub, dirty mirrors, and yellowing on the toilet. We have to determine whether it's wear and tear from living in the unit or damage from negligence by the tenant. Our job is to make that determination for our owners upon move out. We also do a six-month walkthrough to make sure the home is cared for, four months if the unit allows pets. We provide pictures of the walkthrough, guaranteed.

The first thing you must do as an owner is notify your current insurance company that you’re not using the property as your primary residence. This is an important detail for insurance companies because that makes the property an investment property. After that’s done, we first recommend you **take out a renter’s insurance policy that covers at least $10,000 in personal property.** This is primarily to cover your appliances. This sum won’t be enough to cover a disaster like a wind storm blowing off your roof, but we’ve been fortunate enough in Hawaii to mostly avoid hurricanes and other storms capable of that kind of damage in the past 100 years. Your liability coverage will be $100,000, which is in place in case an accident happens on the property. The other thing we recommend for owners is to **get loss of rent coverage.** This is important because if there’s a leak or your home incurs some type of water damage, the tenants probably won’t be able to reside in it and pay rent. The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment. As an owner, your liability coverage will be $100,000.  What do we ask on the tenant’s side?** We require all tenants to carry a renter’s policy**, which is a simple renter’s policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent. If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but aren’t happy about it, the tenant’s coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the owner’s coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses. Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. It’s a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit. If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you! ",

The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment.&nbsp;As an owner, your liability coverage will be $100,000.  What do we ask on the tenant’s side? We require all tenants to carry a renter’s policy, which is a simple renter’s policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent. If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but aren’t happy about it, the tenant’s coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the owner’s coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses. Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. It’s a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": " &lt;/i&gt;** *We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee.** How does that work exactly? I’ll take you through each step today.* We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee. How does this work exactly?  The Landlord-Tenant Code is very specific on the steps you are required to take when you’re going to evict someone from your property in civil court.  As soon as we realize that the rents are going to be late, the first thing we do is post a five-daynotice to terminate the lease. We then take a picture of the five-day lease (which is usually posted on the front door) and submit that photo to civil court.  At the same time, we file for an eviction notice for the tenant to appear in court. That eviction notice to appear in court will normally take 14 to 21 days to get served.  Once the eviction notice is served, we get a court date. As soon as the tenant is in court, the first question the judge will ask is, “Do you owe rent on this house and why have you not paid?” The tenants normally answer that question like this: “Judge, we do owe the money, but we have an explanation.”  I will go to the court proceedings along with my property manager for the area. We will testify that the rents are not paid. In that case, we do not take any partial rents for you; if we did, then we couldn’t file for an eviction.  Once the eviction is granted, the judge will ask how many days I will give them to vacate your unit. We will show up on the agreed-upon day with a police officer to accompany them off the property. Once we show up, they have 120 minutes to vacate your home. After they are out, we change the locks, go in with cleaners, and start the re-up process to get your home back on the market.   “ We will choose your tenant and handle any evictions at no charge to you. ” Remember now, every time we move a tenant in and out of your home, we take new pictures and videos of your property. All of those pictures and videos are date-stamped just in case we end up in court.  That is the eviction process. If you elect to use our eviction guarantee, we will choose your tenant for you. We will find a tenant with a credit score of at least 620, and we guarantee to pay for the eviction process. If you choose to select your own tenant and ignore the eviction guarantee, you will have to pay for me to go to court and evict your tenant.  Ultimately, I recommend that you let us choose your tenant. We will look at their credit, criminal, and eviction history, and then check their references from past landlords. If you have any questions about the eviction process or our eviction guarantee, please give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you! ",

Many owners ask, \"How do we handle pets?\" Today, Duke Kimhan from HI Pacific Property Management joins us to discuss pet deposits.  First of all, **we do walk throughs on all the properties we manage.** If you have pets, we conduct a four month walk through. **We also require an additional deposit of either $400, $500, $600, or $1,000, depending on the size of the animal.** This deposit is required before we finalize the lease. Background checks, credit checks, and work verification are also required before the lease is finalized. For military tenants, we verify their contract with the HR department.  Most people these days have some kind of pet. Families that rent for a longer period of time tend to have pets. HI Pacific Property Management is here to protect your home.
