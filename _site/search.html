        "category": "",
        "content": "The fact is, there isn’t much more to the average agent than the agent themselves. Most agents operate a one-person show and they are probably breaking their backs trying to do a good job for their clients. Most agents couldn’t work harder than they are already working.Sometimes, clients can actually suffer from their agent’s good intentions. The fact is, you may be sympathetic to the fact that your agent is working as hard as humanly possible, but if the quality and profitability of your home sale suffers as a result of them trying to do everything themselves, you have the right to feel cheated.The simple explanation is that we have built a team of professionals to help us be in 10 places at once, therefore greatly enhancing the quality of service we can deliver to our clients. This is how other professionals like your banks and lawyers run their businesses. On top of that, we have used cutting-edge technology to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, and innovative capabilities of every part of the service we deliver.“We sell our clients’ homes for more money.”We don’t expect you to care about the fine details of the inner-workings of our office. What you should care about is that because of the highly unique way we have structured our real estate office, our clients’ homes sell for more money in less time.Our team sells a lot of homes. We have extensive home selling experience that puts more money in our clients’ pockets. To find out more about how our team approach can make you more successful in the real estate market, simply visit www.getmorewithus.net and fill out the form.

        "content": "For most people, “getting top dollar” is number one on their list of goals when selling their home. These same people, however, feel ill-equipped to achieve this goal.Since various market factors can cause large swings, pricing a home is an imperfect science to begin with, and the skills of the person responsible for negotiating for the home can also impact the outcome of the transaction.However, negotiating effectively doesn’t have to be as difficult or scary as you would expect. Like anything else, if you have a proven system to follow and know the signals and language, you can successfully turn the tables in your favor. Who better to borrow these skills from than professional negotiators who sit across the table to try to out-bargain their opponents every day?“The art of negotiation doesn’t have to be difficult or scary.”The system we follow as professionals is outlined in a new, free special report for home sellers that explains the four most common mistakes sellers make when negotiating the sale price of their home. One local area resident credits the knowledge gained from the information revealed in this free special report with netting thousands more than their original asking price.To get this report, visit www.mostmoney.net and find out how you can get the highest possible price when you sell your home.If you’re thinking of buying, selling, or investing, please visit our website, give us a call, or email us today. Keep it real, Vancouver—we look forward to hearing from you!",
