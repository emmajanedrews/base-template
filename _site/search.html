        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Lately, I’ve been getting a lot of questions about  Zillow, including whether I use it to purchase leads, what kind of ROI it brings, and whether the site is worthwhile as an advertising tool at all.Zillow is a great, user-friendly platform, but it does have some drawbacks. It doesn’t update in real time, for instance. There are a lot of listings our buyer clients might find on there that are shown as active on the site despite already actually being under contract or closed. This can cause a lot of frustration for consumers.As for whether it’s worth it to purchase leads on Zillow, it depends on your market. I can tell you that if you visit the site’s advertising portal, it’ll actually show you the availability for each ZIP code as well as ROI projections based on how much you spend. I’ve found that these ROI calculations are pretty accurate. They have a lot of data to draw upon. According to Zillow, the average Realtor who purchases ZIP code leads through their site will see a 3% to 4% conversion rate. In other words, an agent purchasing a hundred leads would end up closing on three to four of them.Some Zillow representatives have even claimed to see a conversion rate of up to 10%. This is fantastic, but you would really have to work your leads to see such high conversion. Having said that, the ROI Zillow estimates you will make on a specific ZIP code is based on a few different factors.  It’s based on the average price point for the area and also the assumption that you are seeing a conversion rate of 3% or 4%. In addition, it also depends on how many leads you’re purchasing and how much those leads cost.In our area, the average ROI that is shown across local ZIP codes is usually about 2.2x to 3.5x. The more expensive the ZIP code, the higher the cost per lead is. Consumers in these more affluent areas, though, may be more careful about giving out personal information and therefore more difficult to reach. It can be easier to convert leads in ZIP codes with lower price points, but you have to convert more leads to make the same amount of money when working with lower price points as opposed to higher ones.“The ROI you are willing to earn in your business is completely up to you.”The ROI you are willing to earn in your business is completely up to you. It’s all relative to the lead sources you could, or already do, invest in. However, returns look much different for single agents versus teams. Let’s say an average team will pay out 50% of their commissions to an agent. If that commission check is $10,000 and the ROI is 3x. If you’re investing $3,300 into 16 Zillow leads and you’re able to convert one, that $10,000 commission check is essentially a 3x return for a single agent.However, if a team owner invests $3,300 into 16 Zillow leads and converts one, this is a pretty high conversion. The $10,000 commission check is then split between the agent and the team owner. So the agent gets $5,000 and the team leader gets $5,000. But if you look at the true revenue, which subtracts expenses from the net total, your ROI ends up only being 1.5x. In other words, you would be spending $3,300 to be making approximately $5,000 in total. For most teams, this simply isn’t worth it.There are a lot of lead sources out there that can bring returns as high as 30x to 40x. A source that brings you a consistent rate of return is the obvious choice. It doesn’t make sense to allocate your resources into an investment that brings smaller returns. If you do plan on investing in Zillow, make sure you negotiate with them on getting either your 10 most expensive or 10 most recent listings for free. Getting the ROI on ZIP code leads from Zillow is all about striking an equilibrium.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of people have been asking me recently about how to advertise on Realtor.com.There are actually two different ways to advertise on this website: Connections With Buyers and Advantage Pro. Today, I’ll start with some of the things I like and dislike about each of these options.Let’s start with Advantage Pro. In my opinion, Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for. It’s pretty simple. You’re paying to get the leads from your listings.The way Realtor.com charges depends on how many listings you carry, the average price point of those listings, and how many of listings you sell.These and other factors are put into an algorithm to give you the price you’ll end up paying for this service.Think of it this way: An agent in California who is selling $2 million properties should probably be paying more for their leads than an agent in our local area selling properties at an average list price of $100,000.For me and my market, I have an average price point of $285,000. So, I’m paying about $40 to $43 per lead through Advantage Pro. At the end of the day, I’m getting a 4.5x return on my investment. When you buy an Advantage Pro lead, you are the only agent who has access to that lead.These Realtor.com leads also often convert a lot faster than leads you get from other sources.The other way to invest in Realtor.com is by using Connections With Buyers, which is where you are purchasing ZIP code leads. There are two ways to use this.“Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for.”You can either purchase a lead and be the only agent who receives that specific lead, or you can share the lead with another Realtor. In the latter option, you and another Realtor, chosen at random, have an equal opportunity to capture the lead. It all comes down to who is able to reach out more quickly. Splitting leads as opposed to having sole access actually makes the investment more cost-effective.If you’re really good at lead conversion and have a quick response time, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be splitting leads when using this service. In fact, the ROI on these leads is higher when you split them. When you split these leads, the ROI can be between 3.5x or 4x your investment. If you aren’t splitting them, the ROI on those leads is about 2.5x your investment.I personally don’t invest in Connections With Buyers anymore, though. In my opinion, it just isn’t worth it.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "A Realtor’s Guide to the Industry: How to Get Online Reviews",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How can you get online reviews from mainstream websites such as Zillow, Realtor.com, Google, and others that potential buyers and sellers are likely to use?First of all, Realtor.com doesn’t have any client testimonials. Homes.com, on the other hand, allows you to copy testimonials you may have from other websites and place them on their site. Sites like Zillow require the client to put a review into their systems. They have validation techniques to make sure that people aren’t fabricating reviews.You can take advantage of the closing process to get reviews from clients. Have your Zillow or Google profile pulled up while you’re at the closing table and, in the middle of your conversation about their experience, simply ask your clients to leave a review for you.On our team, we like to hold review contests. These are best done on a quarterly basis, and usually result in a flurry of reviews. You don’t have to choose incredibly expensive prizes and gifts to incentivize clients, but in order to see whether or not that affects the outcome, we are offering up an iPad Mini, an Amazon Echo, and also an Apple Watch for our next contest.For these contests, we call up past clients and ask them to participate in the review contest. One review on Zillow or Google, for example, will equal one entry into the drawing per site. If they leave a review on both websites, it will equal three entries. The contest lasts about three months, and when it’s over, we’ll draw three winners and announce them to our database. It will help to incorporate the news of these contests into your videos. For example, in some of my own videos, I will attach the announcement to a market update video, with the announcement gaining more urgency as the contest draws to an end.“Consumers will choose the Realtors that they want to work with based on online reviews, much the same way that people choose restaurants or other establishments.”Consumers will choose the Realtors that they want to work with based on online reviews, much the same way that people choose restaurants or other establishments. Getting a five-star review is critical. Anything less than that could hurt you substantially. Using these contests is a way for you to get more five-star ratings.Websites like Yelp are a little more difficult. It’s not quite as popular in Charleston as it in California. If a client happens to use Yelp, their review will only stay on the site if they are an active user. Reviews that are left by one-time users appear suspicious to the site, which might assume that a business person created their own profile to leave reviews and boost their own business. In these cases, reviews are removed after a certain amount of time.It’s so critical to have a strong online presence with reviews. People will research you and your company to make sure that you have a good reputation and brand. It’s especially critical if you do invest money in websites such as Zillow to get leads because they’re advertising multiple people on the same listing; if you have more reviews than the other agents listed, then it’s more likely that someone will reach out to you for a question. The same is true for agents with more detailed profiles set up.Hopefully, this information can help you garner more reviews which are so essential to the business. If you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be more than happy to help.",

        "content": "If you’re interested in growing your database, here are a few tips I used right off the bat with my own database that will help you.The first place you should go is LinkedIn. There’s a feature you can use that can export all of your contacts out of LinkedIn, along with those contacts’ phone numbers, names, work addresses, and email addresses. Those are all critical pieces of information you need in order to communicate value to those contacts through your database marketing plan.The next place to look is Facebook. Facebook has made some changes that have made exporting your contacts through them more difficult, but if you have a Yahoo email account, there’s a way to sync it with your Facebook account so all your Facebook contacts can be exported into your Yahoo contacts.“LinkedIn is a great place to start building your database.”Aside from those two avenues, we also all use multiple email accounts, including spam accounts, personal accounts, and business accounts, that each have the capacity to export all of your contacts. Most of these accounts are pretty reliable when it comes to saving contacts as you communicate with people.There are other methods we used to build up our database as well, so if you’d like to know more about this topic or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of people have been asking me how to develop a great business plan. As I started writing down notes on the subject, I reflected on the steps I took to create my business plan and what it took to follow through on it. Today, I’d like to discuss this subject and also tell you about five books I believe will help your business.There are seven components I wrote down pertaining to the development of a great business plan. The first is to have a vision. You need to understand why it is you want your business to be successful. For some further reading on this point, I recommend checking out Simon Sinek’s “Start With Why.” This will help you develop the mission of your business, which will then carry through to helping you create a culture and energy that fits your vision.The next book I recommend is “The SWOT Analysis” by Lawrence G. Fine. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The first two components are internal qualities you should examine within yourself, and the last two components refer to external factors. Thinking critically about these components will help you narrow down the purpose of your business and how you want to target that purpose.“In order to reach your goals, you’ll need a strategic plan.”Another book I think you should check out is “SMART Goals” by Jacob Gudger. This book specifically will help you set and reach goals in a practical manner. SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable,  realistic, and timely. These are all qualities that a good goal should have. An example of a good goal would be wanting to earn $100,000 in real estate from ‘X’ number of homes at an average commission over the next 12 months.But in order to reach these goals, you’ll need a strategic plan. For this, I recommend reading “Mastering the Rockefeller Habits” by Vern Harnish. (You could also read “Traction” by Gino Wickman, and/or “Rocket Fuel” by Gino Wickman and Marc C. Winters.)Next, you want to consider the time frame. Develop your plan for moving forward by dividing goals and projects into the next one, three, and five years. If you just develop three to five goals you need to accomplish each quarter, you will reach your goal in five years. Gary Keller’s “The One Thing” is a good read that covers this subject.The final thing you should do is to develop systems and processes. The best thing you can do is to stay in production, but hire an admin to help you develop these things while you’re continuing to produce.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "How can you establish your personal brand as a new agent? It’s not as difficult as you think it is.First of all, you have to define why you are doing what you’re doing.  From there, you can establish the values you have within your team or within your business if you want to be a solo agent.Think about the people you want to impact, why you want to impact them, and what kind of market you want to work in.Once you define that, you can develop your own personal image. Since you don’t have anything to fall back on as far as your business image, it’s a great time to recreate that for yourself.Pick things for your logo that are emblematic of your own values. That will ring true for the culture you have for your business when you meet with new clients or hire new people. It’s really important to identify those values and make sure people see them through your marketing.“Define why you are doing what you do.”Finally, determine your unique selling proposition as a Realtor. What makes you unique? Why would someone hire you as opposed to a different Realtor?There are many things you can offer to set yourself apart. We offer different guarantees so that our consumers know we have a higher level of accountability. Some people decide to work within a defined area and become an expert in that area. No matter what it is, choose something that makes you unique and differentiates you from other Realtors out there.Everyone has a relative or friend in real estate. You need to make sure that you stand out from the crowd and come up with good reasons why people would like to work with you.If you have any other questions about establishing your brand, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Many sellers have recently asked me how we have such great turnout at our open houses, so I wanted to share some quick advice.We have a 15-page marketing page that explains our whole open house process that I’d be happy to send to you, but for now, I wanted to give you the main points.Start by keeping the home clean and maximizing the curb appeal. The home should be completely decluttered and the curb appeal should be 10/10 because it means everything. People will drive up to the house, take a look, and keep on driving if the curb appeal isn’t up to par. If it needs to be painted, get it painted. If it needs pine straw or mulch, get some. To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.It takes about 90 minutes to prepare for our open houses because we put up more than 100 signs. We’ll put one sign per turn in the neighborhood, and once we get to the major arteries outside the neighborhood, we’ll put 10 directional signs pointing to your neighborhood from one direction and 10 more from the other direction. That way, traffic on both sides of the street can see the signage.“To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.”Additionally, we generate a lot of interest with our digital marketing. We have a database of more 800 active buyers looking to buy a home, so we’ll not only market to them, but target people on social media who are likely to make a move. We run marketing campaigns for about a week in advance to drum up interest.Publications also work great, so I publish a 15-page real estate-related newspaper that goes to 28,000 homes with an open house section where we feature homes. Finally, we try to get everyone to register once they come in so we can follow up with them and ask questions.Again, if you’d like our full 15-page document, I’d be happy to share it with you. If you have any questions about open houses or anything in your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!",

How are they able to do this? A lot of their success is due to one simple tool that will change the way you approach your career.It’s a simple form called “Dominate your day, win your week!” and it’s something our team members fill out each day. It helps you plan out your day to make it as productive as possible. There are six steps to personal productivity mastery:  Focus, do not multi-task, and eliminate distractions.  Make lists based on dollar-producing activities. 20% of your activities will produce 80% of the results.  Prioritize everything you do based on your goals.  Protect your time blocks. Plan your day in 30-minute increments and don’t let anything interfere.  Eliminate clutter.  Plan your week on Sunday and plan each day in advance.Once you figure out what your top money making activities are, put those on your list first. Then, you can fill out the different time slots, noting when you plan to start and stop. As we move down the form, you have sections for determining how much each activity is worth to you so you can wrap your head around what it will cost you to neglect those activities.There’s also a section on there for you to write down your “10 wins for the day” to give yourself a more positive focus. Sometimes a win is setting an appointment. Sometimes it’s having lunch with your spouse. It’s important to keep things in perspective.Finally, there’s a section on the form for you to write down notes. Anything that comes to mind during the day can be written, including notes for the day and things you might need to add to your dollar-producing activities.If you have any questions about this form or would like to get a copy of your own, just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one.
