        "title": "How the Fed’s Recent Rate Hike Impacts Our Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.“These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.”Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call at (561) 352-3056 or send me an email at lisa@treugroup.com. I’d love to help.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether you’re a buyer or seller, I have important news to share with you.  Interest rates, as we know, have been on the rise. Why does this matter?  If you’re a buyer and rates go up just 1%, you’ll lose 10% of your buying power. This means you may have to settle for not living in the neighborhood you want or giving up that pool you wanted. That’s not what you want, right? I know that’s not what I want for you.If you’re a seller, rising interest rates mean fewer buyers can afford your home. Fewer buyers mean fewer offers.“TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.”There was a study published recently that no one’s talking about but I think you deserve to know about. The study showed that in South Florida, there’s less than a 10% chance that our real estate prices will decrease in the next two years.As a buyer, you might have both higher interest rates and higher prices, and that’s not good for anybody.We are here to help you capitalize on the opportunity in the current market, so if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "The real estate market can be a little bit confusing, especially if you’re getting your information from friends, family, or the news. So I wanted to give you some accurate information about the Palm Beach County market.Last month, we had 5.1 months of inventory. That means we’re still in a seller’s market. If you’re looking to buy, you’re going to need to be prepared, and if you’re looking to sell, you’re going to be pretty happy.35.7% of all transactions that closed last month were cash. There were no appraisal contingencies and no financing in these transactions. The median price was $327,000 and that number keeps rising. We still have room to grow, as the number when we were at the height of our market was around $375,000.A question frequently asked is this: “Are you buying or selling in a buyer’s market or seller’s market?” It depends on two things: the area and the price range that you’re in. For example, if you’re buying or selling a single-family home in the $200,000 to $250,000 range, then you’re in a very strong seller’s market. There are only about two months inventory in this price range.“THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.”If you increase your budget and you’re buying or selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, then you’re still in a seller’s market and there’s only about three months of inventory. Sellers are receiving multiple offers for these homes and buyers are going to have a hard time beating out the competition.If you move into the luxury market ($600,000 to $1 million range), you’ll see we’re in a buyer’s market. We have nine months of inventory in this market, so if you’re looking to buy then you’ll have plenty to choose from. The same goes for homes that are priced at $1 million or more. We have 16 months of inventory available in this market, making it a strong buyer’s market as well.There’s always an opportunity in the market. The question is how do you capitalize on that? Here at True Group Real Estate, we’ve been helping buyers in the seller’s market get the home of their dreams. If you’re selling, we want to help you get the most money for your home.If you’re in the luxury market and you’re frustrated because your home isn’t selling, we have the right formula to get a sold sign in the yard and you to the closing table. The formula is simple, but it isn’t easy; you need the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing. We can help.If you have any other questions about real estate, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to help!",

If you call the listing agent, you will probably hear that the property has already sold. That’s because there is a delay between what you see on those websites and what professional agents see. As real estate agents, we actually get a head start of up to seven days on the best properties.So, how can you find a listing online that hasn’t already gone under contract?You can do one of two things. First, you can search on a site like ours, which pulls information directly from the MLS. That way, when a home hits the market, you will know right away. The other option is to allow us to do all of the hard work for you.“OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.”The last few buyers we’ve worked with only viewed four homes until they found their dream home. That might not seem very impressive, but one of those buyers had been searching with another agent and on their own for two long years.If you are selling your home, are those websites your friends? Not really. It’s important to understand how Zillow impacts your pool of buyers. If Zillow has a wrong Zestimate or other incorrect information, it can cost you thousands of dollars. It may even cost you the home sale.It’s important to understand how these sites work and competitively list your home in the right place.At Treu Group real estate, we understand how to help you buy, sell, and, most importantly, how to help you win.

        "content": "There are opportunities in every real estate market, and I want to share three of them with you today.First of all, a recent study revealed that almost 50% of all millennials in south Florida live at home. If you want to build wealth in the United States, the first step in creating wealth is to own your own home.While this may not be possible for all millennials right now, some millennials should definitely consider packing up and buying their first home. If you have a great job, a steady income, and you’ve saved some money or have access to gift money, then now is a great time to get into a new property.Let me tell you a quick story: When I first purchased a home, I got a 13.5% adjustable mortgage rate. Compared to today’s low interest rate, you can see that homes are more affordable. You can ask your friends and your parents what their first home’s interest rates were, and I think you will agree that even a 4% interest rate is an absolute gift to the real estate market.“OWNING A HOME IS THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING YOUR OWN WEALTH.”Secondly, if you already own your first home, now is a great time to upgrade to your next home or maybe even your dream home. Why? If you sell your current home, you are probably selling in a seller’s market. Depending on what price range you are moving up to, you will likely be buying in a buyer’s market. So, the market currently allows you to sell in the best position possible and have more options when you go to buy.Finally, if you are ready to retire and want top dollar for your home, you can definitely win in this market, especially if your home lines up with what millennials are interested in. Why? Right now, we have a shortage of great homes in certain price ranges. Anything under $500,000 often receives multiple offers, great prices, and great terms.So, it is time to capitalize on these three great opportunities in our current market. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Should you offer a buyout? Should you agree to sell the home? Which option is the best one for you?“”When people get divorced, they are dealing with a loss of the future. They are thinking about all of the dreams that they planned as a couple and watching them disappear. People try to hold onto that future and make emotional decisions, such as paying too much to retain the home. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell the home and get a new start.The third major life event that can be challenging is when you lose a loved one. The biggest mistake I see is that people either sell too quickly or hold on too long. I believe that there is a natural period where you need to have your time to grieve.

Today I’ll explain how the groups stand to benefit from market conditions.We believe there’s always a great opportunity to be had in the real estate market, and you just have to position yourself to take advantage of it. That’s why today, I wanted to talk a bit about some of the great opportunities that will be available in the Palm Beach market in 2017.The first opportunity lies with people currently renting homes. As a renter, your rent payment goes up when your landlord’s costs go up. By buying a house in 2017, you can lock in two things: your interest rate and your property taxes. If you rent, it’s time to get off the fence and into your new home.Move-up buyers also have big opportunities in 2017. Many homeowners have a home in a seller’s market price range, giving them the perfect chance to move up into their dream home. If you own a house under $400,000, it’s likely the best time for you to take advantage of the record-low rates and the cooling luxury market. You would be selling in a seller’s market and likely moving up to a buyer’s market.“IF YOU RENT, IT’S TIME TO GET OFF THE FENCE AND INTO YOUR NEW HOME.”Finally, the third big opportunity is for those of you looking to buy real estate as an investment to have tenants and positive cash flow.If you have any questions about how you can take advantage of the market in 2017, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you.Finally, if you take a look in the video above, you’ll see that I’m in an iconic part of Palm Beach. Do you know where I am? Send your guess and you might just win a prize!

Over the past few years, Canadians have been a huge influence on the South Florida real estate market. However, we currently have a currency issue.

        "content": "Since market values have gone up 9.5% on our taxes for homesin the past year, you need to know how to budget for your tax amount.Property taxes are an important part of our budgets when we’re buying a new property or looking at how a property cash flows. This past year, our market values went up 9.5% on our proposed taxes for our homes. What does that mean?If your property was homesteaded, it likely means absolutely nothing. For example, for my primary home, the market value actually went up $125,000, and yet, my assessed value only went up $2,000. If you own an investment property or a commercial property, however, you don’t have that benefit. You may be a little shocked this year when you get your tax bill, but you can make that payment in November.The other person who might be a little shocked this year is the one who purchased a home last year, especially if that home had the “save the home” benefit. You may have budgeted for a lower tax amount or had a lower tax amount in your escrow account, and now you’re having to make up for last year, plus your lender will adjust your escrow account for next year.“IT’S NOT IMPORTANT WHAT THE TAXES ARE TODAY, BUT WHAT THEY’LL BE IN THE LONG TERM.”We’re getting a lot of calls from buyers and sellers who are confused about taxes, especially those who’ve just made their purchase. If this includes you, here’s my advice:If you already own a home and it’s not homesteaded, and it’s now a financial challenge for you, give us a call and let’s look through your options. Maybe that property that did create cash flow is no longer the right option.      If you just purchased a new home, make sure you file for homestead exemption. That will save you thousands of dollars in the future, plus provide other benefits.        If you’re in the home buying process, it’s not important what the taxes are today; focus on what they’ll be in the long term. What you need to do is look at the current owner’s market value versus the assessed value. If there is a differential, your taxes will likely go up in the future. That’s OK as long as you budget accordingly.  This is important to remember if you know your escrow account might be a little short. You can set that money aside and you won’t be as surprised next year when you receive a higher tax bill.So, go ahead and file for the homestead if you can. If you sold a home in Florida and purchased another home in Florida this year, you have another benefit called “portability.” That means you take some of your benefits of that previous home—the tax savings—and bring it to your new home.If you’re interested in learning more about property taxes and homestead exemption in Florida, click here.

        "content": "Today I wanted to switch things up a bit and share with you the four lessons that I learned while on vacation in Greece. There are lessons all around us everywhere we go.The first is to be open-minded. One thing I was really concerned about was the cuisine because I wasn’t sure if I’d like it. I didn’t like Greek yogurt, but what I discovered was that I just had never had great Greek yogurt. In Greece, we enjoyed fresh Greek yogurt every morning, and it was delicious! Imagine if I had been unwilling to try something new— I would have missed out on discovering one of my new favorite things.The second thing I learned was to be willing to try something new. We also rented scooters and ATVs in Greece, which scared me a bit because we weren’t familiar with the area, and honestly, they drive a little bit crazy over there. We decided to try something new, though, and we got to see parts of Greece that we would never have gotten to see if we hadn’t been willing to just give it a try.“ALWAYS BE WILLING TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.”Another thing I learned was to treat everything like an adventure. Even something like getting lost can be fun. Look at life that way— what are you doing in the moment, and how can you make it fun and exciting instead of just looking at what’s wrong.Finally, the fourth thing I learned was to set big goals and allow yourself to dream bigger. My husband and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary, and we thought back to our honeymoon. It was very different than this trip; it was a very short weekend trip, which we thought was wonderful at the time. Because we’ve allowed ourselves to think big and dream big, we were able to take this amazing trip.I hope you’ll take these four lessons I’ve learned and give them a try to create something amazing for yourself.

They have two 18-hole courses, which are both beautifully maintained. They are North Palm Beach County’s premiere mini-golf courses. After you’ve played a round, you can go have a burger or ice cream sundae at their fast casual restaurant inside. They do corporate events as well as children’s parties.South Florida has no shortage of great restaurants. One of our favorites is &lt;a href=”http://www.roccostacos.com/” target=”_blank&gt;Rocco’s Tacos.&lt;/a&gt; They even have multiple locations in the area, so you’re never too far from one. They make delicious tableside guacamole. &lt;a href=”http://www.utikibeach.com/” target=”_blank&gt;U-Tiki&lt;/a&gt; is a great place too.

When you’re done eating, you can head on down to their dock and hop on a paddleboard or kayak, which you can rent right there.If history is more of your thing, check out the &lt;a href=”http://harboursideplace.com/” target=”_blank&gt;Jupiter Inlet Museum.&lt;/a&gt; It’s an amazing place, and you can even take a tour of the lighthouse.“MANY OF OUR BEACHES ARE WORLD-FAMOUS.”One of my favorite parts about Palm Beach County is the abundance of shopping, restaurant, and entertainment options available. &lt;a href=”” target=”_blank&gt;Harbourside&lt;/a&gt; in Jupiter, Downtown West Palm Beach, and City Place in Clematis are all great hotspots.

        "content": "One of the common questions I get from my clients is how quickly can they enter back into the real estate market if they have suffered through a short sale, deed-in-lieu, foreclosure, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.You need to know a few things first. Depending on the type of loan product you used and which of the four procedures you went through, your time away from being allowed to purchase will vary.However, most people can enter back into the market in two to seven years in order to get financing.“NON-TRADITIONAL FINANCING MAY BE A VALID OPTION FOR YOU.”One other option if you’re almost done with your waiting period is to use non-traditional financing. The interest rate for these loans will be a bit higher, but you can qualify one day after a foreclosure or a short sale. That way, you can get into a home, and then refinance after your waiting period is over.Last but not least, don’t forget to check out one of our favorite restaurants in Palm Beach: Old Key Lime House. Come and enjoy the great views, amazing food, entertainment, and a nice cocktail if you’re in the mood!If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us!",

If you’re thinking about selling your property, there are a few things you can do to get top dollar.First, look at your kitchens and baths. Kitchens are what sell homes, and baths are what keep buyers in that home. Now, that doesn’t mean you have to start from scratch on the kitchen. Instead, find a great new granite or quartz countertop that will help you achieve that luxury feel. You can also do simple things like updating your lighting and your faucets.What else do you need to do? Many people need to simplify and reduce clutter. Having a light, open home will definitely help you get top dollar.Plus, you always want your flooring to be in great condition, so **consider updating or replacing that used carpet. **I have a few other tips for you, so give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions.

        "content": "How do the latest real estate statistics impact your home value? Today, I’ll go over some interesting information from the Palm Beach County real estate market. First of all, I want to show you the hottest market in Palm Beach County. The number one zip code for home sales is 33411. The people in Royal Palm are pleased with that. Last month, they had 99 closed home sales.The top five markets are all Western Communities. These include cities like Palm Beach Gardens, Wellington, Lake Worth, and Boynton Beach, zip code 33437. Boynton Beach is an ideal area for seasonal guests. Statistics also reveal the number of days on market is down year over year. However, that number has increased in the last couple of months. If you’re thinking about selling, it may take you a little bit longer to get that contract, so we need to talk about when the ideal time would be to list your property.Inventory is growing. We’re still in a seller’s market overall, and some areas are in a very hot seller’s market. However, inventory is going up. The luxury market in particular is definitely seeing more and more homes come on the market. That said, 24 zip codes in Palm Beach County did not have a single sale last month. Not one condo, single-family home, or villa sold. There are really two different markets here in Palm Beach County. Now more than ever, real estate is incredibly local. To find out if you’re in a hot market or a cool market, just give me a call. I’m here to help. I look forward to hearing from you!Click here to view the full Palm Beach County statistics for January 2016.Click here to view the local market update for January 2016. ",

			<p>Lisa Treu knows that creating opportunities is what she loves to do each day. Selling Real estate is more than selling a house, it is someone’s home and each closing is treated with care.  In 2014, Treu Group Real Estate was honored to earn the endorsement of Real Estate Mogul and member of Shark Tank, Barbara Corcoran. Additionally, due to our innovative marketing, we were the only local real estate company or agent nominated as the 2014 and 2015 Top Real Estate marketer in North America. Lisa is honored to bring current real estate information each week on WJNO. Lisa is here to help Treu Group Real Estate clients get to the closing table.  Lisa understands luxury real estate, marketing, negotiating, and studies the market to help our clients get ahead of changes that are always happening in Palm Beach and Martin County.</p>
