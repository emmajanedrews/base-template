        "content": "What’s the latest word from our Memphis market?We’ll get to that, but first, we have an exciting announcement to make. We’ve helped 118 families buy and sell homes this year, but as you know, we’ve been asking people to vote for one of two local charities—Hope Works and Youth Villages—to win our 100th home sale giveaway and receive the majority of the proceeds from that sale.The voters have spoken, and the 1st place winner of our 100th home sale giveaway is…Hope Works!We were glad to be able to drop off our check to this wonderful organization and learn more about their ministry in the process. We were also happy to deliver Youth Villages their 2nd place check and learn more about them as well.“Overall, the market is still good.”Now, let’s look at the latest numbers from our market and how they compare with where we were this time last year.The number of units for sale is up 14% compared to July 2016. For the first seven months of the year, they were up 9% compared to last year. The average home sale price is up 3%. Interest rates are rumored to be going up again in the future, but we haven’t seen anything yet. Overall, the market is still good.If you have any questions about our Memphis market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to get in touch with us. We’d love to help you!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I recently read an article in Realtor Magazine that claimed 2017 was the best year in a decade for new construction homes—not just in the Memphis area, but everywhere.According to this article, “A shortage of homes for sale combined with growing buyer demand will likely spark home builders to construct the most homes this year than in the last decade.”If you’re interested in buying a newly built home, there are a few tips you should know to make the process go smoother.First, choose a reputable builder. Make sure they’re a member of the Home Builders Association (in our case, the West Tennessee Home Builders), which allows them to provide a one-year warranty. Beware of all of the add-ons, too, because there are many things that could be considered upgrades that might pull you out of your budget. Stay involved in the building process and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Also, learn about the surrounding neighborhood before you buy.“Stay involved in the building process and don’t be afraid to ask questions.”Next, be flexible. With the weather being how it is, builders can’t always determine when your house will be totally completed. They should be able to keep you updated and informed, but you’ll need some flexible dates in mind so everything can be controlled.Lastly, it’s not a bad idea to have a home inspection. The builder will do a walkthrough with you, but it’s still worth the money to have a home inspection and let someone else take a look at the home to make sure nothing gets overlooked.If you have any questions about buying new construction or any other real estate topic, feel free to give me a call. I’d be happy to speak with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to give you an update on the latest numbers and trends that we’ve seen in our real estate market. According to chandlerreports.com, June was a great month and we saw a lot of promising trends, such as:  Overall home sales are up by 8%.  Average sale prices are up by 5%.  Bank-owned property sales are down by 20%.  Home sales over $500,000 are up over 30%.As far as that steep drop in bank-owned property sales is concerned, it’s actually a good sign for our market. A drop in the number of foreclosed properties is good for your resale value. There are still foreclosures available out there, but they are a little harder to find now.“Bank-owned properties are down a whopping 20%.”There is a chart below that shows the numbers for all the different municipalities in the area. As you can see, the average sale price has increased in Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, and Germantown.The market is still very strong for sellers, but we aren’t seeing as many multiple offer situations. If you have any questions about the market or about your home specifically, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you.",

Here are our top three tips to protect first-time homebuyers:  Know what you can afford. This doesn’t just include your mortgage payment. You need to make sure you can afford that in addition to property taxes, utilities, and various other maintenance fees.“HOME VALUES HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR BY YEAR IN MEMPHIS.”      Choose your lender wisely. Online lenders aren’t always the best option, even if they advertise the lowest rate. You should really get a recommendation from a Realtor or some other person you trust. Local lenders tend to work best in terms of being able to close on time.        Don’t overlook the details. Purchase contracts have a lot of them. Take your time to read through it carefully and don’t hesitate to ask your Realtor any questions you have.  These are just three tips for successfully buying a home for the first time. If you would like some more tips or just have a question, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "If you’re looking to buy a home here in Memphis, you might have to compete against other offers for a home you like.For starters, remember that no other buyers know what the offers are, so you don’t have to worry about your offer being revealed. However, you can do a few things to make your offer better.First, put down as much earnest money as possible. This speaks volumes to the seller about your interest level in the home and that you can follow through with the loan process. Putting down a small amount means you don’t have any skin in the game, and the seller might not see your offer as worth it at that point.Secondly, show the seller that you are qualified for a home loan. Get fully pre-approved for a loan instead of just getting pre-qualified, which carries less weight. An offer with a pre-approval is akin to a cash offer for a seller.“SHOW THE SELLER THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR A HOME LOAN.”You can also give the seller extra time to move. Call the listing agent and ask them what’s important to their seller, because it’s not always all about money. For example, I recently worked with a seller who needed to rent the house back for a couple months after closing because they have a handicapped child. There are many situations going on in people’s lives, and accommodating them can help you win the home.Finally, add a personal touch by writing a letter telling the seller why you love the home. Also be aware of what you’re willing to pay for the home.If you have any questions about multiple offer situations when buying a home, give us a call or send us an email soon. We’d be more than happy to help!",

Don’t close any accounts or open any new ones when preparing to buy a home. Also, make sure your credit to debt ratio looks good on all your open accounts. If you have a $500 limit, don’t let the balance sit at $495.Next, don’t switch jobs. If you do need to switch, try to stay in the same field so lenders have information about the switch. They want to see some job security, so if you’ve hopped around a lot that can be a problem.“DON’T CLOSE ANY ACCOUNTS OR OPEN ANY NEW ONES WHEN PREPARING TO BUY A HOME.”Pay attention to your balances. If you have a high limit and you’ve maxed that out, it won’t look good to lenders. On the other hand, if you had a credit card that you use and pay off regularly, lenders will love that.Finally, don’t make any big purchases until after closing on a home. After you’ve got the keys to your new home, feel free to get that new furniture, just hold off until then.If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Unless you live in the downtown area, you should have received your appraisal by now.If you disagree with your appraisal, you can go to the Shelby County tax assessor site and fill out an informal request for a reassessment. You don’t have to provide a lot of documentation for an informal request, so it is a fairly easy process. That said, there is a short time frame for informal requests. Beginning on May 1st, you can make a formal request. That is a much more involved process.“MAKE SURE YOUR LENDER IS USING THE CORRECT TAX ASSESSMENT.”If you are selling your house and your taxes have gone up, this could impact you. Since taxes are divided between you and your potential buyer at closing, the buyer could come to you and ask for additional taxes since your appraisal went up.If you are a buyer and you are currently under contract to purchase a home, make sure that your lender is using the correct tax assessment. Unfortunately, in some instances even a slight increase in monthly taxes can make a huge difference between getting approved for a loan or not.As always, if you have any questions about this topic, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Interest rates have been a hot topic recently, so today, I’ve brought in Wendy Thompson with the Wendy Thompson Lending Team of Bank of England Mortgage to help me explain.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% last week, and the market actually responded very positively. Rates had been rising before, but we’ve actually settled with rates at about 4.25% with FHA, VA, and USDA interest rates at 4%. The Federal Reserve anticipates two more rate increases of 0.25% this year as well.The good thing is that despite the recent rise, rates are still very low. If you’re thinking about buying a new home, it’s better to act sooner than later.Rates have been so low for so long that it’s actually better for the economy for them to go up now. After all, we all want our retirement funds and investments to do well also. The impact of rising rates on your costs isn’t substantial either. For a $200,000 home, a 0.25% increase in rates only equates to about $25 more per month. Historically speaking, having rates this low is great compared to the 18% I saw when I started in real estate.“RATES HAVE BEEN SO LOW FOR SO LONG THAT IT’S ACTUALLY BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY FOR THEM TO GO UP NOW.”Many people don’t know that mortgage-backed securities control mortgage rates. That’s why it’s important to work with a mortgage lender who follows rate changes daily. As Wendy says, it’s a bit volatile right now because things outside of the country can even have an effect on rates, so they can change on a dime. Having a knowledgeable lender is more important in these conditions.If you have any questions for Wendy about rates or getting approved for a home loan, you can reach her at Wendy@TheWendyThompsonTeam.com or give her a call at 901-461-8858.As always, if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

After all, the way we live in our home every day is different from the way we live in it after it has been on the market. Here are five things you need to pay attention to when selling a home with pets:      Tufts of fur: If you have a cat or dog that sheds, you need to clean up the extra fur that gathers around the house so that your home doesn’t look messy.        Floor stains: Redo your hardwood floors if need be and make sure that any pet stains are cleaned out of the carpet.  “CLEAN UP ANY PET STAINS TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY.”      Pet odors: You can get used to the smell when you live there, but you don’t want buyers to walk in and think your house smells like wet dog. Pet stores sell products, like candles, that will cover up pet odors without being too overwhelming.        Scratches and dings: Puppies love to chew and scratch at things. If you have marks on your furniture, there are special pens out there that can cover those up. Pay attention to your windowsills and doors, as dogs tend to scratch on those as well.        Bowls, pet beds, and litter boxes: Put away all of the pet paraphernalia that you can and make sure that the litter box is clean; buyers don’t want to see or smell that.  Take care of these five things so that your home shows well. If you have any other questions about selling with pets or about the home-selling process in general, give me a call or send me an email.

There are plenty of things you may have put off, like new appliances or granite countertops, so why not enjoy them a bit before selling your house? Give yourself a chance to cook with those new appliances first.The second reason to start renovations early is that they always take longer than you expect. If you get an estimated timeline of six weeks, plan on 12 weeks. It’s just the nature of the beast. If you plan for this, you won’t have to be stressed about getting your house finished and on the market in a certain amount of time.Thirdly, you might run into issues that you’re not aware of. A big part of my job is going to potential listings early to get a look at things that might need to be done. We often uncover issues that you never notice because you live in the home every day.“YOUR RENOVATIONS DON’T HAVE TO BE MASSIVE.”Your renovations don’t have to be huge. I’m not talking about taking things down to the studs for a renovation. In fact, that’s not beneficial in many cases. **My goal is to get you $3 in return for every $1 you spend. **The fifth reason is that in this competitive market, you simply might need renovations. With the popularity of HGTV in the last few years, we see that buyers simply want what they want.
