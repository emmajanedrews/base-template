During that time, he noticed his team was referring all of their short sales over to agents on our team.Benjy took note of our good reputation and decided to make the switch. What ultimately motivated his move to our team was that he didn’t want to be a solo agent anymore. Being part of a team where you have a specific duty is something he was definitely attracted to.“At Team Lally, we create great experiences.”Team Lally has a “great team environment that is based around continuing education,” says Benjy.As a listing partner for our team, Benjy specializes in getting listing agreements signed and properties sold.The thing he most enjoys about working with Team Lally is our atmosphere.

        "content": "Today I want to talk to you guys about video marketing and how you can use videos to leverage your overall business in the real estate industry.Initially, I wanted to talk about this subject using PowerPoint slides, but to really bring the point home, I decided to make it into a video. The great thing about doing this on video is that I won’t get that awkward silence when I ask for questions or feedback. What’s more, if someone misses something, they can go back and rewatch the part they missed or didn’t understand fully.Today, I’ve got four tips for you, which I turned into the acronym SEER (Story, Educate, Entertain, and Retention). Hopefully these tips will make your video marketing more effective in your business life.Since there’s a lot to cover, I’ll timestamp each section so that you can learn about each one at your leisure—yet another awesome aspect of video!  Story (1:40)—make your videos revolve around a story.   Educate (2:34)—come from a place of education.   Entertain (3:35)—make your videos as entertaining as possible.   Retention (4:03)—edit your videos so that the audience will watch the whole thing.   7:28—hear examples of ideas I have that utilize SEER.   8:30—a note about potential compliance and legal issues that you might come across if you don’t perform your due diligence.Personally, being in front of a camera is very awkward for me. Even though I’m uncomfortable doing it, it’s going to improve my speech, communication skills, my knowledge of the industry, and so much more.If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact me via phone or email, or keep an eye out for my future video blog posts. Thank you all so much, and have a great day!",

A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market we’re in.Here’s what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.It’s not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success. How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.“WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.”That is an example of having the right strategy—we adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference?

        "content": "*What does it take to be a leader instead of a manager?You can start by asking questions instead of giving answers.*Today we wanted to give you some helpful information on how to be a leader.Managers give answers –  Leaders asked questionsManagers manage work –  Leaders lead peopleManagers develop subordinates –  Leaders develop other leadersManagers dictate plans –  Leaders cast a visionManagers insist on control –  Leaders inspire collaborationManagers are also accustomed to being the go-to person for answers they’re used to given direction and giving their opinion it makes them feel valued important and reinforces their position of authority.  Also some managers prefer to deliver answers because they think that it will save precious time.Unfortunately when managers routinely dish out the answers they become enablers that to a dysfunctional cycle.   Which is actually a huge time waster now because team members regular have to seek out the manager for solutions rather than being problem solvers themselves.“Stop giving answers and start asking questions.”This prevents the ability to develop real solutions. Stifles the team member growth and ultimately limits the organization’s productivity. Additionally when team members are used to going to the manager for answers and direction they actually transfer the ownership of the problem from themselves to the manager. Consequently they can then blame the manager for the goals shortcomings and failures.It is no longer their fault because they didn’t provide the solution.  The manager did. Assigning team members with the task of uncovering the reason for their list goal or creating a viable solution to a problem challenge puts the responsibility back where it ultimately belongs.   So how do you do all this by not providing answers.  Instead answer every question with a question. Teach people to think and learn and grow for themselves.Click on this link we’ve provided to a Darren Hardy video to learn some awesome concepts from him on how to be a great leader.He mainly talks about training your people to be problem solvers. Darren also talks about how managers give answers while leaders ask questions. He recommends that you stop giving answers because when your team members problem solve on their own, they take ownership of the problem.If you have any questions give us a call or send us an email.

I watched Adrienne and Attilio thrive during the market collapse of 2008 and 2009 when quite a few of us were being taken down. During that time, they built a great business, so I was very impressed.What motivated you to join Team Lally?I was motivated to join Team Lally because of their success. They have a great track record and they’re extremely successful in the marketplace. As I was wondering about the future of my own brokerage, I would see their signs all over my own neighborhood and the surrounding areas.“I joined Team Lally because of their success.”What’s your role on the team?My role on the team is as a Listing Partner. That means I work with owners and sellers but not with buyers.What do you enjoy most about working on a team?I enjoy working on a team because of the efficiency it produces and the camaraderie it provides. Each transaction is dealt with in such a way that so much gets done in such an efficient manner. Additionally, the team ends up becoming your friends and family. I have many friends here on Team Lally, and I enjoy that. Experiencing the negotiation of transactions with our chief negotiator Howard Net has been phenomenal. All of the other agents and our administrative staff have been great to work with as well.If you have any questions for Brooks or need help buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",
