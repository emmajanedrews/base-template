        "content": "A lot of people are asking if we’re in a bubble. To figure that out, the first place we should look is at the numbers themselves.A lot of people have been asking if right now is a good time to buy or sell. But, another broader question I’m hearing a lot is, “Are we in a bubble?”To figure that out, I think it’s important to look at the numbers. Over the last three years, **the market has seen consistent growth and the interest rates have generally stayed low. **We can see from this that there isn’t a very high likelihood that the Feds will be raising interest rates in a significant way. In fact, some people are saying interest rates could even drop.The lower interest rates are, the more people can afford. This is especially important since the somewhat drastic increases we’ve seen in prices over the last two to three years. Right now in our area, we’re starting to see prices similar to those we saw in 2006, 2007, and 2008.Though interest rates typically rise along with price, this isn’t a trend we’re currently seeing. We can expect prices to continue to rise.**We’re also seeing homes spending fewer days on market, as well as lower inventory overall. **“IF YOU’RE THINKING OF BUYING, NOW IS STILL A GOOD TIME.”However, if you’re thinking of buying, now is still a good time.If you’re considering selling, the most important thing is to pay attention to supply and demand within the market.Overall, I’d have to say that most people would not agree that we’re in a bubble.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you are looking for an agent to help with your real estate transaction, how can you know if they will do a good job?With the recent influx of agents into our area’s market, a lot of people have come to me asking, “How do I find the right agent?”The answer depends on what kind of real estate transaction you’re about to undertake. If you are in the market to purchase a home you should be looking for a lender.But don’t settle for your first encounter, be sure to shop around to get the best rates and the best terms and conditions on your mortgage. You should also get a buyer’s roadmap. A buyer’s roadmap will show you how we get priority access to all the best deals on the market.This will help you win out against the competition. Having the roadmap will be your guide to success as a buyer, but you’ll still need a quality agent. When looking for the right agent, be sure to ask how many homes they sell per year, how well they know the area, and how well they know financing.Sellers will need a game plan, as well. Having a selling guide and using high-quality marketing will be key. **My team and I offer a 151-step marketing guide that can help you have as smooth and successful a transaction as possible. **“VERY FEW OTHER AGENTS, OR TEAMS OF AGENTS, CAN DO WHAT WE CAN.”Full-disclosure, full-detail marketing strategies are also something we do. From 3D tours to aerial drone shots and more, we have all the resources to help our sellers make their listing as attractive as possible. We also offer a 75-point photography checklist designed to ensure that your home is being presented in the best light.Very few other agents, or teams of agents, can do what we can—let alone at such a high level.To find out if an agent will be able to get you top dollar, there are a few questions you should ask as a seller. How many homes have they sold this year? Do they have a resume?With as many agents as are coming in our area, we’re seeing a few of them underpricing homes and therefore only selling between two to four properties a year. Selling quickly isn’t worth it if an agent is undercutting their client’s profit by thousands.One of the things that sets my team apart is that we only accept full price offers for our clients. You need an agent who has a game plan for getting you at or above list price.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

The people leasing the home really wanted to list the house. I told them that the problem was that they wanted to list the house—not try to find a buyer and sell it in a reasonable amount of time for top dollar.“DON’T ASK SOMEONE TO SELL YOUR HOME UNLESS THEY SELL HOMES REGULARLY AT A HIGH LEVEL.”Someone once told me that when you ask someone to do something they don’t normally do at a very high level, you probably won’t get the best results.

You could be setting yourself up for failure without even trying.We’ve been noticing that a lot of our clients over the years have misconceptions about how buying new construction homes work. We wanted to go through the process and clarify any questions you may have today.If you’re considering building a new home, it’s always best to go into the process with an agent who has experience working with and negotiating these kinds of deals. You might think that you could save some money as a buyer by not using an agent, but you would be completely wrong.If a builder knows you don’t have representation, they are going to run you over and you will end up overpaying for a property. Until you have an agent who knows what they’re doing when it comes to negotiating with these builders, you won’t have as successful of a home purchase as you could have had.“AN AGENT CAN HELP YOU GET A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND BETTER UPGRADES.”By working with an agent, you can get a lower interest rate, better upgrades, and other discounts that you wouldn’t be able to get on your own. The expertise of an agent really pays off in situations like this. If you’re working with one of our buyer’s agents here at the Dan Jones Team, let them know if you’re interested in this kind of property.Speaking of our great agents, let me give a shout out to one of our new agents, Karen, who has been doing fantastic as of late putting homes under contract and is working with several new construction buyers right now.In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Box up all of the items you don’t need and put them in a storage unit. Decluttering ensures your home feels cozy, and buyers are more likely to see the value in a decluttered home.        Repaint the doors. Adding a fresh coat of paint to the doors will make them feel and look new. Buyers will take notice and really appreciate that detail.        Repaint the trim. You don’t need to paint every bit of trim in the house, but make sure you hit the main walking areas, bathrooms, hallways, and the kitchen.        Spruce up the landscaping. Get some mulch and freshen things up. Also, make sure two days before you get pictures taken you mow the grass and clear the driveway off.Assuming there are no major issues with your carpet or flooring, hitting the basics is going to get you the biggest return. By doing so, your home will be 75% more likely to sell than other homes. Just remember not to over improve your home by taking on huge projects like the ones on HGTV.

Why?Well, if you look at the numbers and how many homes are on the market versus what actually sells and closes, the percentage is ridiculously high. In February and March, the same number of buyers are out there, but inventory doubles or triples.“YOU MIGHT NOT GET AS MANY SHOWINGS, BUT YOU WILL MOSTLY DEAL WITH SERIOUS BUYERS.”Right now, the only buyers out there are serious ones. This is because they may have had a shift in income or a job change. Whatever their reason, they need to close on a home quickly. You might not get as many showings right now as you would during the rest of the year, but the people looking will always be serious buyers.If you’ve been thinking about selling, get a time set up with one of our listing specialists to get a full equity evaluation on your property to see what’s going on in the market in your area and what your competition is trying to sell for.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I’ve gotten a lot of questions recently about Zestimates, and I’m going to address them today. A Zestimate is just what its name implies - an estimate of your home’s value. An estimate is a reasonable approach to value in regard to real estate, but an estimate is, by definition, inexact. Enjoy using a Zestimate as a tool, but don’t be surprised by the inaccurate information that you receive from it.Why are Zillow’s Zestimates so inaccurate? There are a few reasons. First off, Zillow doesn’t look at supply and demand. They look at recent comps, but not recent appraisals. They also pull from tax records, which can be extremely inaccurate as well. If you use that data, you could be misrepresenting your home’s value by as much as $60,000 or $70,000. Tax records aren’t a good tool for estimating a home’s value.“Your home could be worth $60,000 or $70,000 more than you think.”Another thing Zillow’s Zestimate doesn’t take into account is location. Your home may have five or six different good comparables, but Zillow won’t be able to determine whether you live in a location that would boost your home’s value. If you live on a golf course, cul-de-sac, or a wooded lot, Zillow would not factor that in.Finally, Zestimates don’t take upgrades and updates into account. Your home’s value will be determined in the same way whether you have a fully remodeled kitchen, bathroom, or basement. Assigning a list price to your home based on a Zestimate could be hugely detrimental to your sale.I have a rental property that Zillow recently told me is worth $80,000 more than it really is. If anyone out there would like to buy the home for the Zestimate price, let me know and we’ll get a contract written up. Otherwise, if you have any other questions or want to know what the true market value of your home is, give us a call. We would be happy to do an equity evaluation for you and give you a professional opinion on how much your home should sell for.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "There are several hidden costs of selling a house people usually don’t find out about until they get to the closing table. What I want to talk about today are some of those major expenses.First of all, if you haven’t lived in your house for very long, there is a good chance you’re going to be paying a capital gains tax. It’s a good idea to speak with your accountant to confer over this.Next are the seller closing costs. A lot of agents like to beat around the bush about who pays what, but it’s important to know this up front when you’re deciding who you’re going to sell your home to and at what price. Closing costs consist of attorney’s fees and deed stamps.“It’s important to know your closing costs up front.”Repairs to the house is another cost to consider. They might be simple, or they might be complicated, but almost all homes end up having repairs. Just getting an electrician through the door can cost as much as $150. A lot of buyers also like to ask for a home warranty. We don’t encourage our sellers to buy those up front because we’d rather wait for the buyer to negotiate that in and move up the asking price of the home.Finally, you have costs like additional repairs or attorney’s fees. If there are any title issues, we strongly suggest that you clear them up beforehand.Be sure you’re aware of these omissions when it’s your time to sell so you’re prepared for the process. If you have any questions, please send me an email or give me a call. As always, I look forward to your referrals and talking to you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Homeowners can lose thousands of dollars when they sell their house for a number of reasons. How is it possible to lose money when selling, you ask?In Carolina, we’re probably in one of the best seller’s markets we’ve seen in a decade. We have great comps to get homes sold, but when people are valuing their home, they aren’t doing a full equity evaluation and really understanding what the market can absorb. Many people are simply getting a comparative market analysis (or CMA) and underpricing the home, only to see it sell in a few days for up to 6% less than they should have.If your home is worth around $300,000 or more, that’s a lot of money to leave on the table.“Pricing a home too high or too low will cost you in the long run.”Secondly, overpricing is a way people are throwing away money. I have people tell me they want to start their home priced $30,000 above what it should be. The downside is that the home’s going to sit on the market for a long time, and even if you find a buyer, the home probably won’t appraise for that price. If a home sits on the market, you’ll have to lower the price. By the time the price comes down to where it should be, buyers will think there is something wrong with the house and they won’t even come view it.What you end up with is a house that sat on the market for around 200 days that ends up selling for up to 15% less than it should have if it was priced appropriately.Finally, choosing the wrong agent can cause you to lose tens of thousands of dollars. You want to make sure the agent you hire has a full marketing budget to get your house proper exposure. There are a lot of new agents out there who just don’t know the market. If you’re not selling a lot of homes, they may end up underpricing and losing you money.Let me know of any questions you have about pricing your home, or if you’re considering buying or selling a home.

However, now there are plenty of comparable sales to support those increases, and the market is on fire.Why is the market so hot? The main reason is we have very low supply and very high demand right now. We are shifting into a seller’s market as there are not a lot of homes to choose from. Properties that are prepared properly and positioned well in the market sell pretty quickly and for top dollar.Secondly, interest rates are very low. Two or three years ago, many people suspected we would see 5.5% interest rates in 2016, but rates have held consistently over the last year or so. In fact, rates have actually come down a little bit. These low rates mean it is still very affordable for you to buy a slightly bigger home or even build a house.“Do not underprice your home in this hot market.”If you are thinking of selling in this market, I have one warning: Do not underprice your home. Since the real estate market is picking up, there are a lot of newer agents getting their licenses and diving into the market.

You could lose 5% to 10% of your true home value when you underprice your property.If you are thinking about selling, give us a call or send us an email.
