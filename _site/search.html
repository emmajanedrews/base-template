        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why can’t you get traditional financing if you want to buy a bank-owned REO property?Institutional lenders have very strict underwriting guidelines, and they have a four-point inspection that any bank-owned property would have to pass wherein each of the following points would have to function properly and be up to code:The HVAC SystemThe electrical systems and electrical panelThe plumbing and fixturesThe roofOftentimes, homes coming through foreclosure have been subject to what I call “duct tape maintenance.” They’ve gone through many years of decline because whenever something broke and the owner was having financial problems, they used duct tape maintenance because they didn’t have the money to get it repaired properly. Because of this, these properties will fail one—if not all—of the criteria in the four-point inspection. Occasionally, I’ll see some of these listings that say they accept cash or conventional financing. Here’s the problem, though: If you put in an offer on one of those listings with a financing contingency, it will go right to the bottom of the offer pile because that home likely has other cash buyers interested in it who can close much more quickly. By the time you’d be able to get that contingency satisfied, that property will be long gone. “Homes coming through foreclosure have often undergone “duct tape maintenance.””There are some exceptions. FHA offers a 203(k) loan that provides for the purchase and repairs of the home, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get that finished, and I rarely see those examples make it to closing because, again, you get beat out by people who have cash offer who can move quickly and don’t have any contingencies. Private money lenders will also lend on these properties, but that’s a subject I’ll talk more about after the first of the year. In the meantime, if you have any other questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you. ",

        "title": "4 Things Sellers Can’t Afford to Slack On",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "As we approach selling season here in Florida, there are four things that sellers must require of themselves and their listing agents.1. You must have professional photos. Don’t settle for your listing agent to come through and take grainy cell phone pictures. Also, wait until you have the entire photo portfolio ready to go; don’t let your agent go live on the multiple listing service with only a couple photos, with the rest to follow at a later point. The full photo package will help your home pop right as it hits the market.2. Your home must be priced right. Listen to your Realtor; they know the market and what an appropriate price would be. If you’re not sure, get an appraisal. For a relatively low cost, you can get another opinion and another idea of what the price should be. Appraisals are also useful tools for listing agents to use in selling that property.3. Your home must be easy to show. If a buyer’s agent looks at the showing instructions and sees a complicated or limited time frame in which they can view the home, they won’t view the home if they can avoid it. 4. You need a listing agent who has a strong internet presence. This is especially true here in Florida; most of our buyers are from other regions, so they’ll need to be able to easily find your listing, your Realtor, and your photos.“If your home isn’t getting showings or offers, it is due to something lacking in at least one of these four areas.”I will guarantee you if you have your home listed and it’s not getting showings or offers, it is due to something lacking in at least one of those four areas.Like I said, we are heading into selling season in Florida, so if you’re thinking about selling, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Recently, a new top 10 list has come out for the most profitable cities in the US for home flipping. WalletHub just conducted a 150-city study to get these results, so let’s dive into what they found.First of all, coastal areas are mostly off-limits for this move. The cost of getting into these areas is generally high, so you might do better in some smaller markets. Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for example, was No. 2 on the list. However, one coastal city market did make the top ten list. That city was Tampa. But on a more specific scale, location will still matter. You can fix a house up, but you can’t change the neighborhood. Most people look in lower price points for homes to flip. That being said: don’t overdo it. Going overboard with renovations on a lower-end home will not be worth it. Remember, there won’t be any TV crew or ribbon cutting ceremony when you put these homes back on the market. “Flipping is not for the weak of heart.”Look for properties that don’t need more than a single major repair. I recommend skipping over any home that you aren’t truly equipped to take on. Also, consider renting out properties for a while instead of selling right away. Rentals are a great way to ride out appreciation. When you do sell, though, think about seller financing. This is another great vehicle for you to get some additional cash.In short, flipping is not for the weak of heart. You need cash, you need to move quickly, and you need to know what you’re doing.Here is a list of the top 10 cities:  El Paso, Texas  Sioux Falls, South Dakota  Fort Wayne, Indiana  Peoria, Arizona  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Tampa, Florida  Grand Rapids, Michigan  Boise, Idaho  Greensboro, North Carolina  Springfield, MissouriIf you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Some stay a week or two, some stay a month, and some own homes here and stay all season. They have a big seasonal effect on our real estate market.If you’re currently a homeowner in Florida and thinking of selling, I want to give you a word of caution about pricing. There are currently 3,032 homes with pools priced under $500,000. That’s a lot of competition for you if you have a similar home. The bottom line: Listen to your Realtor’s suggestions when it comes to pricing. If you think the home is worth more than they do, get an appraisal to settle the score. The appraisal will also be a great selling tool for your Realtor down the line.“Snowbirds have a big seasonal effect on our market.”If you’re thinking about buying a home down here because you’re a snowbird yourself, there is a lot of great inventory out there now. The seasonal peak hasn’t hit yet, so you can purchase in a much less competitive market. There’s no guarantee that owning a home in Florida is going to be more affordable. Even after the recent hurricanes, our market still keeps chugging along.If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or about the real estate market in general, give me a call or send me an email.

How well would that work out?Your Realtor is another professional who’s there to help you, but they need all the information you can give them in order to do so. Not being straight up with your Realtor may not kill you, but it may get in the way of you getting a really good real estate deal. Here are a few tips for communicating with your Realtor so the transaction goes smoothly for the both of you:Discuss your financial situation with them. If there’s a problem, talk to them about it—they may have a solution. Be candid about what you qualify for or if you do or don’t have a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter. Talk about what price range you want to shop in and what are your “must-haves” versus your “like-to-haves.”Talk about your communication style. Are you a person who prefers texting, talking on the phone, or talking via email? How frequently do you prefer to communicate? This information will help you communicate in a positive way and get the job done. Bring up any expectations that aren’t being met. Be straightforward if you’re working with other Realtors. Some Realtors are OK with this, while other aren’t. Some take it as a challenge to be better than the other person you’re working with.“Be respectful, be courteous, and communicate.”Unlike your doctor, your Realtor is working on commission, so they’ll work very hard to get the job done for you. They won’t make a penny until it is. Be respectful, be courteous, and communicate. If you have any further questions about communicating with your Realtor or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Gulf Coast area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Working with an experienced Realtor is always a great idea, but is there any benefit to working with someone who’s new to the business? Actually, yes. New agents have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. However, if you’re going to work with a new agent, they must be part of a team. In a team environment, these new agents will have the help of other, more experienced agents. This situation really brings you the best of both worlds. Experienced agents on the team can take care of negotiations and contracts, while the newer Realtor will provide a lot of vigor. Just like medical professionals, many Realtors have begun working more often in teams in order to provide a higher level of service. A real estate team will generally consist of several professionals who each play a different role. For example, the team leader will be the one who communicates directly with you and makes sure that everything is coordinated.“When you work with a team, you have the benefit of combined experience, skills, and resources.”Newer Realtors will often take on roles like that of a showing agent, since this will help them really become immersed in a neighborhood. However, once you start making offers you’ll generally work with someone on the team who is a little more experienced. Someone who specializes in contracts and negotiations will be a great asset in this process. When working with a team, it’s common for you to work more closely with different agents at different points throughout the process. Try not to feel like you’re being handed off. The reason this happens is because different agents have different skills that are best suited for various stages of the transaction. Instead of feeling as if you’re being passed around, remember that when you work with a team, you’re being granted the benefit of combined experience, skills, and resources. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Qualifying for this kind of underwriting will involve looking at finances, documents, and the property’s management team. Another difference is that getting VA or FHA financing for condos will be difficult.

That is a startling fact—six deals a year isn’t enough to truly get the kind of experience people will want and expect from a professional. There are too many things that can come up in a real estate transaction that won’t necessarily happen all the time. If an agent isn’t doing enough deals, then they aren’t being exposed to those kinds of learning experiences.You must have an agent with deal IQ. This only comes from experience through working many deals. You want to make sure that if a problem arises, your agent knows how to handle and solve that situation before it gets worse.Don’t risk this huge investment using an inexperienced agent. Check their online profile, see how many deals they’ve done recently. Additionally, just because an agent is with a big-name brokerage doesn’t necessarily mean they know what they’re doing. Be sure to do your research— Zillow is a great resource for vetting potential agents.“Don’t risk this huge investment using an inexperienced agent.”New agents are great in that they’re enthusiastic and excited to jumpstart their careers, but they should only be hired if they’re working with a team of professionals to back them up.

We’ll go through the whole coast from Charlotte Harbor to Tampa Bay.In Charlotte Harbor, you’re going to have saltwater canals and harbor fronts giving you access into the harbor. You’ll see properties going for $250,000 and it will more than likely be an older and smaller home, but it’s a great place to start your boating adventures.Englewood is another great place, as it sits right on the Gulf of Mexico and features saltwater canals. This area is better if you own smaller boats, and for $450,000 you’ll be able to get a home with quick boating access to Gulf.Coming up the coast to Venice, Nokomis, and Osprey, you’ll see similar opportunities as Englewood. The difference is you’ll see prices start to rise from $450,000 and up if you want to get into good water.Heading further north, we have Sarasota which is a very metropolitan area with a lot of amenities. Housing prices overall are considerably more expensive than the communities to the south. Boating opportunities in Sarasota are going to start around $550,000 but the best properties are going for $1.2 million and up.

        "content": "It’s hard to believe that we are six months into the year. And just like time, the market moves fast. Since we’ve reached the middle of the year, I thought now would be the perfect time for me to share some of my thoughts with you on how our market here in Florida is coming along.  Now as we’re going into July, it’s important to note that there is still a big lack of inventory—especially when it comes to homes under the $200,000 mark where many of you are shopping. Those homes are moving at a rapid pace—oftentimes fewer than 30 days on the market. However, when it comes to homes priced from $350,000 and up, their time on the market jumps up slightly to about 45 days on average. A step further up to higher price points, though, shows much less consistency as luxury homes tend to follow different market trends.So what does this mean for you as a buyer? First of all, it’s important to sort out your financing. Secondly, take a good but realistic look at your want list. Keeping your budget in perspective and listening to your Realtor can help immensely with not only this but the entire process as well.“In this hot market, you can’t afford to ignore your Realtor’s advice.”If your Realtor advises you, for example, that they think the house you’re interested in is going to move quickly—don’t ignore their advice. Doing that could result in your future home slipping right through your fingers. Particularly in our Southwest Florida market, things simply move too quickly for buyers to stall on their decisions. And if you don’t trust your Realtor, you may be working with the wrong one.If you are a home seller, things are looking good. However, be careful not to become overzealous and price too high. If you do, the home will likely sit on the market for too long and go through days on market fatigue. With the market moving quickly and homes going off the market on an average between 30 to 45 days, buyers will become wary if they see your home still sitting after much more than that. Another final thing to keep in mind is to be prepared when interest rates go up. Be sure to keep an eye on this, as it can definitely influence the market. That being said, buying a home now will certainly be less expensive than it will be next year.

You might be able to afford more home than you think. For example, did you know that most counties offer assistance for down payments and closing costs for first-time homebuyers? Here in Sarasota County, the county offers up to $7,500 in down payment and closing cost assistance contingent on some credit score and income limits. There’s also a cap of about $270,000 that you can spend on a home. If you want to learn the specifics of these programs, talk to your lender. If they can’t or won’t tell you about them, it’s time to move on and ask your Realtor to recommend someone who can go through the options with you. “If your lender can’t or won’t tell you about these programs, it’s time to move on to a new one.” Another unique option for more seasoned buyers—those age 62 or older—lets you purchase a $400,000 home for a one-time payment of about $200,000. You can do this with a home equity for purchase mortgage. This lets you preserve your cash and never make another mortgage payment. How’s that sound for your retirement funds? This option is known as an FHA non-recourse loan. The only requirements are that you are 62 or older, keep up with the tax and insurance, and use the home as your primary residence.  If you have any questions about these two financing options or about buying or selling real estate here in Florida, give me a call or send me an email.

They might ask whether you’re a cash buyer, qualified for a loan, paying cash, or simply how you’re paying for the house in general.  This is a big part of your Realtor’s job because some properties might only qualify for cash purchases, for example. Some might qualify for conventional mortgages but not FHA or VA mortgages. Your Realtor simply can’t help you find a home without knowing what you’re qualified to buy. Most commonly, they’ll want to know whether you’re pre-qualified and for how much. Your offer on a home should also include that letter of pre-qualification. Without it, your offer isn’t going anywhere. If you’re a cash buyer, your Realtor will want to know how much you can spend and they’ll want to see your proof of funds. Like the pre-qualification letter, your Realtor will submit your proof of funds along with any offers you submit.“With a pre-qualification letter, your offer isn’t going anywhere.”You should be concerned if you haven’t had this conversation with your Realtor early on in the home buying process, and certainly before you start looking at homes.

Of course, you need enough income to qualify for a second mortgage loan, but if you do, you can line up your new home and list your current home.“Every deal is different, so you need to speak with a real estate professional.”If your home is currently listed, you can put in an offer that is contingent on your current home selling. A lot of sellers will accept that because they will see that your home is on the market and is probably getting showings, meaning your sale is moving forward. You need to give that seller a pretty strong offer, but we can get that deal accepted.Every deal is different, so you need to speak with a real estate professional to see if they can make something work for you. If you have any questions about this topic or any other real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

I’m here to show you how.We’re heading into the “off-season” here in Florida, but summertime may just be the best time to come down to Florida for a family vacation or to look at homes if you’re interested in buying here. The hustle and bustle of winter is over and we’re on island time now.Airfare and lodging are going to cost you about 30% less in the summer than it does in the winter. Home prices also tend to drop off a little bit heading into summer. Let’s just say sellers are in more of a laid-back negotiating mood. This time of year is when the golf is beautiful, the water is nice and warm, and Florida is a fantastic place to be.“Airfare and lodging rates are 30% cheaper in the summer.”So come on down and see me; I’d love to help you plan your summer vacation. I can show you the best spots to visit, the best beaches, and more. In fact, I have a full list of my favorite beaches, restaurants, tiki bars, and more. Let me know if you want me to send you a copy.If I can do anything else for you (including helping you buy or sell a Florida property), give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Tax season is here, folks. You’ve probably already submitted your documents, but if you want to get a head start on next year, you should consider investing in a property here in Florida.Investing in real estate continues to be one of the best ways to cut taxes and build wealth. Tax benefits from income-producing properties include the ability to recover costs, depreciation deductions, and using a 1031 exchange for deferring profits from your investments.Even if you only plan on living here for a few months a year, investing in a property here in Florida is a smart move. Think about it—you’ll be able to buy the house at today’s prices and rates, which are only going up. There are also many tax advantages to consider, as well as the potential of owning an appreciating asset here in Florida. You can rent the property out all year, or just on a monthly basis.“You can buy with today’s prices and rates before they go up further.”If you’re thinking about flipping a home, I wish you good luck. Buying, holding, and waiting for appreciation is the much better strategy. If you think you’re going to get in, get out, and make a quick killing, you’re watching too much HGTV.If you have any questions for me about buying a property in Florida, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to answer them. I can’t wait to hear from you.",

        "content": "Mortgage interest rates are rising, but why is this good news?You might think this effect would push housing prices down by making them less affordable, but Fannie Mae’s research indicates the opposite. They’ve determined that when people feel bullish about the economy, they’re more than willing to take on a bigger mortgage commitment. While it’s true that higher interest rates have a negative effect on marginal buyers, our buyers here in Florida aren’t marginal. They’re pretty well-established, and if they’re not already paying cash, a bump in the monthly rate won’t keep them from getting their dream home. “It’s still a great time to make the move to Florida.”Strength in the economy has the biggest impact on home prices—not interest rates. Interest rates will keep going up, but that’s good news. The future is bright for the economy, and demand for Florida real estate will continue to be strong and unaffected by these interest rate changes. Home values are stable, strong, and will continue to be a great investment. Lastly, there are some really innovative new mortgage financing products on the market right now for people near retirement age, people who are self-employed, and first-time buyers. If you’re in one of those three groups, give me a call so I can help your move to Florida. I look forward to hearing from you. ",

        "content": "Do you know about deed-restricted communities? Many of our communities here are deed-restricted.This means there are rules put in place by the homeowners association pertaining to the land use and look of the neighborhood. HOA fees in these communities can range from less than $200 a year to several thousand for gated communities with lots of amenities.The pros of these rules are that you have architectural and neighborhood standards in place and aesthetics are established. They will be well adhered to by everyone in the neighborhood. You will always be in the neighborhood that has the look that you bought into and your home values won’t ever be dragged down by your neighbors because they’re not taking care of their home or yard.“In deed-restricted communities, the look of the neighborhood is well-established and won’t change.”On the con side, there are rules and restrictions like not being able to park an RV or boat trailer in the yard. You can’t restore your ‘57 Chevy in the driveway or paint your house purple. You might have to get things approved with the HOA as well, like the height of a fence. Many of these things aren’t a big deal, but it will be a deal-breaker for some people.If you’re thinking about moving into an HOA community, talk to your agent first and make sure they give you the HOA documents before you decide. If you have any questions I can answer or I can help you make the move to Florida in any way, give me a call soon. I’d be glad to help.",

        "content": "I get a lot of questions from folks looking to buy a home here in Florida that don’t want to live in a flood zone. It can be tough since our state is a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides, so today I wanted to talk a little bit about flood insurance.Let me tell you that flood insurance is overblown and is not a deal-breaker. You should start out by trying to find a house that you like and can afford and then have your Realtor hook you up with an insurance professional that will give you a flood quote. When looking at homes, you should be aware of the elevation and age of the home. “A home’s age and elevation have the biggest impact on flood insurance premiums.”The home’s elevation is a big determinant of your flood insurance premium. Age matters because after building codes changed in 1975, newer homes would have the lot built up first, then have the home built on top of it. Code changes in the mid-90s and in 2002 meant new changes in the structural requirements of homes as well. This can make as much as a 50% difference in premiums. If you look at homes on the newer end of that scale, the insurance premiums will be very manageable.In short, looking at homes built after the benchmark year of 1975 is good, after 1995 is better, and after 2002 is much better when it comes to flood insurance premiums. Don’t overthink it!I hope this eases any anxiety you have about flood insurance. If you have any other questions or you’re looking to make a move to Florida, give me a call or send me an email.

Zillow is by far the largest real estate search portal, and along with Trulia (who they recently acquired), accounts for over 60% of home search traffic. The other 40% is taken up by Realtor.com and the big brokerages.For buyers, Zillow is an awesome place to begin your home search. There is a ton of good general information, market information and area information, and you can get a good sense of the market prices in your area as well as who the top agents are. This is all good.However, Zillow is not the place you should search for a home if you are less than six months out from buying. If you’re really serious about starting your property search, Zillow’s information isn’t the most accurate or up to date. You will come across some great properties that you will come to find are either sold, expired, or under contract. A site like ours updates in real time. By using a Realtor’s home search website, you will have a direct feed to the active listings on the market and won’t have to waste time looking at homes that are unavailable.“If you’re not working with a Realtor, you’ll miss out on a lot of opportunities.”If you’re not working with a Realtor when buying, you’ll miss out on a lot of opportunities. Work with a professional who will send you information on active properties and give you a good sense of confidence that they know the market.Sellers can get a lot of value out of Zillow, too. You can check out neighborhood prices, among other things. However, your Zestimate may or may not be accurate.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I wanted to explain foreclosures and the foreclosure process in detail because it’s a little bit different in each state. I find that a lot of people—even many Realtors—don’t understand the process entirely.Say you’re on Zillow looking for a deal and you see houses that say “pre-foreclosure,” meaning it’s not foreclosed yet. These properties aren’t on the market, we don’t know what the price will be, and we can’t show it to you. It simply means the owners have been served a legal document called a lis pendens, which is the bank telling them that they’re coming after their property.This process can take quite some time, and the owners still have a chance to catch up on the mortgage during it. It’s really a “nothing to see here” kind of thing. The best we can do as agents is put them on our alert list and give you a heads up when the property comes to market. In most cases, these properties will end up foreclosed. Once the property is foreclosed, it goes to the bank’s asset management department, the number crunchers. They’ll determine what the property’s value is, and they’ll probably have it for 60 days.“Most foreclosed properties won’t qualify for financing because they won’t pass a lender’s four-point inspection.”Once they determine the value, they’ll turn it over to one of us Realtors to list it on the MLS, which then makes it an active property.This is where there are some opportunities if you have cash; most of these properties won’t finance because they won’t pass a lender’s four-point inspection criteria. If you can move quickly and get the property under contract and you can do the work yourself (it will be tough to make money on the deal if you hire contractors), my team is very good at getting these deals done.If you think you want to buy a foreclosure property, give me a call and let’s talk about it. There are a lot of moving parts that you should understand before buying one. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

This means that we now cover the entire coast from Tampa Bay all the way to Charlotte Harbor. Thank you all for your continued support! Now, let’s get to the real estate market.Our new president, Donald J. Trump, is first and foremost a real estate guy. He has indicated his interests in boosting homeownership and reducing regulations in financial markets, which could have a great effect on real estate in general.Interest rates are ticking up a little bit. We expect them to go up to nearly 4.5% by year’s end. If they shoot up near 5%, however, we think the market will cool off a little bit. So, now may be the sweet spot in which to make your move while taking advantage of the historically low rates we are still seeing. “The most important numbers are specific to our local market.”Although national trends are interesting to look at, the important stats are the ones from our local market here in Florida. This market is very unique. We dominate the national price appreciation rankings. People who live here see their home’s value go up quicker than in other parts of the country. When they see this, they tell their friends about it too, which is driving our market as much as anything else is.We predict that the central gulf coast will continue to offer unbeatable real estate opportunities in 2017.

			<p>I’m passionate about Gulf Coast Florida living. The weather, the beaches—it’s a lifestyle that’s only possible in a climate that encourages year-round outdoor living. I knew many years ago I wanted to live in Florida and finally made the move from New Jersey in 2004. I get it, it’s a big move—a big deal. This blog will help you sort out the “where to” and “how to” questions that I know you are asking. Make The Move To Florida will help you get to know the Gulf Coast from Tampa Bay to Charlotte Harbor—the Suncoast communities. I’ll keep you up to date on the local real estate market, plus I’ll go over “how to” financial strategies. It’s my passion to share this beautiful place with you.<br /><br />
When you are ready to “Make The Move to Florida,” my real estate team at Wendy Sells Florida will make it happen. They are the coastal real estate pros. Wendy knows how to get the deals done for out-of-town buyers. Her clients enjoy personalized concierge service and exceptional results.</p>
