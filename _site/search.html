        "content": "Many potential home sellers have been worried about the uncertainties in the housing market in the face of the upcoming presidential election.A lot of them want to wait until the election is over to sell, but that would be a mistake. It’s a great time to sell right now because of all the advantages in the marketplace. Here are six reasons why you shouldn’t wait until after the election to sell:      It doesn’t matter who the next president is. What I mean by this is that the world will continue to spin and people will continue to buy and sell real estate regardless of who is elected to office.    Real estate will still be one of the best ways to build wealth. Again, this is true no matter who wins the election. Real estate is always going to be one of the wisest investments to make.“No matter who wins, the world will keep turning.”      Inventory will continue to constrict because of uncertainty. Most people will decide to take their homes off the market until after the election. This will help you stand out more if you list your home right now. There is a higher concentration of serious buyers in the market who will see your home.        Serious buyers want to move before the holidays. A lot of buyers in the market right now have been looking for months. Many weren’t able to get a home in the highly competitive market this spring and summer, so they have a sense of urgency in wanting to get a deal done.        Many relocation buyers are looking now. Most corporate relocations take place at the beginning of the year. The families that are being relocated are looking for homes right now and checking out the areas that they want to live in. This is another pool of buyers that will see your home stand out.    Interest rates are at historic lows. You’re probably sick of hearing it at this point, but it’s still true. Interest rates can only go up now, and we want you to be able to capture the buyers that are out there right now.If you have any questions for us or are interested in buying or selling a home, we would love to hear from you. It’s a good time to make a move right now.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "It’s not very nice to profit from your neighbors’ troubles. Sometimes, though, there’s simply nothing you can do to stop it.At the beginning of the summer, as I’m sure you have heard, the UK voted to leave the EU. This became known as “Brexit,” and it has created heaps of uncertainty and worry for our neighbors across the Atlantic.Here in the U.S., though, Brexit has been nothing but good news for the real estate market. Because of Brexit, investors all over the world wanted a safer place to invest, and this pushed already low mortgage rates down even further to almost unseen lows.In fact, we are now in the middle of the second-longest run of cheap mortgage rates in history. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 3.46%; this is only a few points above its all-time low of 3.31%.What does this mean for you?First, if you are looking to buy a home, now is an unusually good time to do so because these low rates mean you will be paying less. As an example, taking out a 30-year, $250,000 mortgage today versus a year ago (when the rate was 3.91%) would mean that you would save more than $25,000 over the lifetime of the loan.The other way to look at it is that at today’s rates, you can afford a more luxurious home without paying more. For example, if you were to take out a 30-year mortgage, you could now afford $15,000 more for a home than a year ago while keeping the same monthly payments.Clearly, this is a great opportunity.“Here in the U.S., Brexit has been nothing but good news for mrtgage rates.”Now, if you are looking to sell rather than buy, these low rates also benefit you big time. The more the mortgage rates drop, the more buyers there are, and the greater the demand is for homes.This healthy demand keeps up the price of your home and ensures your home will get sold quickly. Not surprisingly, pending home sales are up by 1.3% this summer and are now at the second-highest level in over a decade.As you can imagine, these ultra-low mortgage rates won’t last forever and will rise sooner or later.If you are looking to take advantage of this unique situation while it lasts, give me a call or send me an email. I’m always here to help.",

        "title": "Fall Is a Great Time to Sell in Mansfield",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I wanted to talk about why the fall is such a great time to sell your home.Sometimes, it really pays to go against the crowd.As you probably know, spring is the season when most people around Mansfield put their homes on the market. Summer is the high season, and it’s when most homes get sold. And yet, there are a few powerful reasons why fall might actually be a better time than either spring or summer to sell your home.It makes perfect sense when you think about it.By the fall, the bulk of spring listings are expiring. As a result, there is less competition, particularly when you consider the NEW label and the fewer days on the market that your listing will boast. Also, home buyers in the fall are more serious. They have been looking at listings for months, and they are eager to conclude their search and move in comfortably before the holidays.“It makes perfect sense when you think about it.”When you put those two things together, you get that homes listed in the fall sell more quickly and often command a higher price. In fact, fall is the season with the highest percentage of sold listings, beating out summer by 1%.Now, if you are thinking of selling your home this fall, there are a few things you have to do differently.First, you have to prepare your home to account for the particular fall conditions. For example, you need to check the HVAC system and replace your furnace filter so your home will be warm and smell fresh. Also, make sure to turn on all the lights; you’ve got to compensate for the shorter, cloudier days. Cleaning up the yard is also a must.The second thing you need to do is price your home appropriately. To get started, check out the value calculator I created that takes into account recent Mansfield sales to give you an idea of what your home is worth right now.Once you have an idea of what your home is worth, how should you price it? On the one hand, the fall is not a good time to start with a sky-high price. If you don’t sell right away, you might not have time to adjust the price because of the smaller number of buyers and the shorter selling period (nobody wants to move over Christmas).On the other hand, those serious buyers I mentioned earlier might be willing to pay more simply because they’ve been looking longer and are more eager to buy.It’s a balancing act. It’s also something I can definitely help you with. Give me a call if you are considering selling this fall, and I’ll give you my recommendations on how to price your home based on current conditions in Mansfield.",

        "content": "If you are considering selling your home in the near future, you are probably planning on making a few renovations. However, some renovations are more appealing to buyers than others.These improvements will actually deter buyers when it comes time to sell your home:  Too much wallpaper. Buyers don’t want to tear down a bunch of wallpaper in order to paint; they want the walls ready for painting when they move in.  Lavish lighting fixtures. You might have a different sense of style than the buyers, so keep it simple when it comes to the lighting fixtures.  Textured walls, wall coverings, and ceilings. Many times, people think they are adding value with different DIY textures when, really, they put up too much. You should also avoid murals, permanent wall coverings, or cute ceiling decals that may damage the walls.  The wrong kind of flooring. Flooring is expensive to replace and the wrong kind of flooring will be detrimental to your home sale. Buyers want plain, neutral decor when they move in.  Too much carpet. Carpet holds dirt and shows traffic patterns. Most buyers do not want to see that everywhere.  Bold wall colors. Remember, bright, loud colors are bad; neutral, soft colors are good.      Swimming pools and hot tubs. You may enjoy a pool or hot tub but most buyers don’t want to deal with or pay for the maintenance.“Keep the decor light, soft, and neutral.”That said, other renovations will add value to your home and net you more money when it comes time to sell. The top four renovations to make when selling your home are:    Renovating your kitchen. Buyers love to see updated kitchens. However, keep in mind that if you spend more than $20,000 on the renovation, you’re not likely to get all of that money back.  Bathroom renovations. Everyone likes to have a large, luxurious master bathroom, and buyers will pay extra for an updated bathroom.  New flooring. You probably can’t clean your carpet well enough to make people think that it’s new; instead, bring in new carpeting or tile. New flooring is a great way to add value and that new carpet smell will give buyers peace of mind.  Curb appeal. When buyers drive past your home, you need to make sure your property makes a good first impression. Plant flowers, trim bushes, and pull weeds. The more organized and orderly your lawn is, the more appealing your home will be to buyers.Now, this one is not on the list, but it’s incredibly important not to forget the backyard.People want to see a yard that they can entertain friends in. A cluttered and unkempt backyard tells the buyer that you don’t take care of your home; a well-cared for backyard with trimmed trees, weeded flower beds, and trimmed grass tells buyers the opposite.If you have any questions about getting your home ready for the market or about real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "It’s commonly known that kitchens and bathrooms sell homes. Making improvements to your bathroom, therefore, is one of the best ways to create value to your home if you’re considering selling in the future. Here are eight inexpensive ways to do just that:  Paint: As is the case with any room in the house, painting is the best way to update your bathroom. Due to the room’s small space, it’s important to use a neutral color.  Paint the vanity mirror. If nothing else needs to be painted, you might consider painting the vanity mirror to contrast the rest of the room.  Replace the vanity mirror.  Update the flooring. Stay away from carpet and laminate floors. If you’re going to do it yourself, there are some great products out there with vinyl flooring that are easy enough to install, but please at least consider hiring a professional for the job. Adding a rug can also accent the room well.  Change the showerhead. If you haven’t modernized the showerhead in some time, go down to your local home improvement store and consider the variety of inexpensive options you can choose from.  Add shelving. If there is any place to add shelving, especially if there is storage needed, don’t hesitate to do so. It’s a nice place to put colorful towels, baskets, and other accents to the room as a whole.  Cover any problem walls. If you have areas on any wall that are showing past damage, or or just have too many white walls, find a solution for them. Even if you have to hire a contractor to come out and retexture, it will be worth it.  Change the lighting. Much like the showerheads, you have a surplus of options in how you would like to replace and update your bathroom’s lighting fixtures. Make sure you choose the right bulbs so the light works well with however much natural light you have coming in already.If you have any questions, or have plans to buy or sell a home in the near future, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email.",

The home is located at 9321 Marble Falls in the Southwind subdivision in the southernmost part of Arlington. At 2,230 sq. ft. with four bedrooms, granite counters, and wood floors, this home has just been put on the market for $240,000. The home’s owner, Carol, is here today to discuss her home, why she’s selling, and why she will be sad to leave it.Carol is actually the original owner of the home, and had it built on-site just over nine years ago. The most important part of the build, to her, was making sure there was plenty of room for family and friends to feel welcome and invited. The open floor plan has helped her achieve this and as recently as two weeks ago, Carol was able to seat 40 people for dinner.“Southwind is a friendly and quiet community.”The master bedroom in the home is large enough to have its own living room, and Carol has even been able to do workout programs like P90x in it without running out of space. The dining room comfortably holds 10 seats, with another eight spots in the kitchen, and four more at the bar.The community of Southwind is very unique. All the schools in the area are within a 5-10 minute drive, and Carol describes the community as “very friendly and very quiet.” This is never more evident than when looking at the backyard. This home’s backyard opens up to a green space with hiking and running trails, with a creek bed on the opposite side.Although Carol is selling because she is semi-retired and choosing to move out to her lake house, she’s sad to see this home go. She’s been very happy with her energy bills at this home, mostly because she had the builder put a radiant barrier on it.We really appreciate Carol taking time out of her day to join us and talk about her beautiful home.

You can see what homes like yours are selling for in the current market.When you evaluate those comparables, you should price your home somewhere right in the middle. We are in a seller’s market, and by pricing your home in the middle, you will generate a lot of competition, showings, and offers for your home. Since so many people will want to buy your home, that competition will drive your home to the highest price you can get.“Price your home right in the middle.”A lot of people are tempted to price their home based off the highest priced comparable. Some people even think that, since prices are rising, they can price over what the highest comparable sold for. If you do that, you will price yourself out of the market. When buyers do their searches using price ranges, they will not even see your home.Ultimately, price your home appropriately.

A private contractor will review all the systems in a home, including plumbing and electricity, in addition to checking appliances. There are so many aspects an inspector takes into account when they go through your property.When you walk through your own home, you won’t be able to detect any problems. Some buyers have more expertise in building and repairing a home. However, the inspector you hire will definitely have that expertise, so you can fix repairs and add upgrades before you even accept an offer. They will always find more than you will just by looking. This is a serious and wise investment that I recommend to anyone selling their home.“I always build in an option period for my buyers.”I always build in an option period for my buyers. During this period, and inspection will happen along with any negotiations for potential repairs, and the contract can be terminated if necessary.

        "category": "",
        "content": "As an experienced Mansfield Realtor, I oftentimes identify common mistakes within the local marketplace. It’s mind-boggling! Today, we’ll review the four most common mistakes, so you can avoid them when selling your home.The first mistake people make is trying to sell their home themselves. One of the biggest reasons to hire a real estate professional is they can market to a wider net of people than you can. You also have limited knowledge of the real estate market. Real estate agents are working in the market all day, every day. We have a level of real estate expertise that you cannot reach and learn on your own. We can help you negotiate contracts and sell for the most money. Don’t miss out on maximizing profit from your property!The second mistake people make is overpricing their home. Everybody wants to get the most money they possibly can for their home. People have a tendency to think their home is worth  more than it actually is. A real estate agent will examine comparable sales in your area so you know what your home is worth in today’s market. By accurately pricing your home, you will sell faster and for more money than you would if your home was overpriced.“Pricing your home correctly will net you more money!”The third mistake is using poor quality photos. Just because your phone has a camera doesn’t mean you should use your iPhone to take pictures for the MLS! Professional photographs will make your home shine, and a real estate agent will make sure that the MLS does not distort the size of your photographs.The final mistake is forgetting about the backyard. We all tend to focus on curb appeal and cleaning the interior of the home but run out of steam when it’s time to take care of the backyard. The backyard matters to buyers, so make sure you get everything neat and tidy.If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

You may not want an older home because you are looking for a newer neighborhood, or you may prefer an older neighborhood with mature trees. Older homes also have different character than newer homes.First, you need to know that the age of the home doesn’t affect its appreciation. You may find a neighborhood that is depreciating rapidly, but those neighborhoods are far and few between.Next, any home you buy, you can upgrade. You may need to make changes for energy efficiency, layout, or other updates. I have seen older homes updated with new windows or roofs to make them more energy efficient. Sometimes making these upgrades yourself makes your property more energy efficient than new construction homes.“You can change almost anything in a home, no matter how old.”Regardless of the age of the home, you need to get an inspection. The inspector will be able to tell you about all the idiosyncrasies in the home so you have a clear idea of what’s going on with the house from the foundation to the roof.My appeal to you is to go with what suits your personality. Don’t let the fact that a home is 50 years old keep you from buying it. The neighborhood should play a bigger factor in your decision than the age of the home.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "Real estate is a fantastic way to build wealth. People have been doing it forever, and real estate investments are actually some of the best long-term investments that you can make.One of the first steps you need to take is to own the home you live in. Once you pay off your mortgage, you’ll be in great position to invest in another property. Interest rates are incredibly low right now, so this would be a very good time to invest in a home.If you’re worried about being in debt because of a new home purchase, I wouldn’t think about it too much. Mortgage debt is the only good debt that you can have. Homes do appreciate, so you can bank on that if you’re worried about stepping too deep into mortgage debt.“Real Estate is the best long-term investment you can make.”Equity can be built pretty quickly after you have purchased a home. It can take five or maybe six years, but after this you can ride a nice wave of appreciation.If you don’t own a home, I would contact a lender and forge out a path for home-ownership. It’s an incredible way to stabilize your family’s financial future.My partner, Trever Kerr, is an excellent lender in the area. You can call him at (972) 822-7408. He is extremely consultative, and he can show you exactly what you need to do in order to purchase a home.If you own a home right now, I invite you to give me a call to talk about investing in more real estate. Interest rates are low right now, so waiting to buy will cut into your purchasing power significantly.Please don’t hesitate to contact me in regard to Mansfield real estate. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Lately, I’ve found myself explaining real estate inventory levels to many people. Our market is crazy right now, and it seems like there are 10 buyers for each house on the market. Guess what? That’s because there is! Right now, there is a supply and demand problem that primarily affects buyers. Essentially, that problem exists because we have not been fulfilling our industry inventory levels since 2008.Before 2008, builders were putting up new homes constantly. Whenever you walked down a street, it seemed like there was a new subdivision. Builders were also putting up spec homes so that people who were unwilling to wait the six to eight months still had inventory to look at. For most of those buyers, the financing has not come around for them to do that anymore. Plus, many builders are still a little gun-shy, as they were stuck with extra inventory back in 2008.On top of all of that, we have an entire generation of millennials entering the market and looking for starter homes. Our inventory just started approaching industry levels this year, and I don’t think the supply and demand issue will be neutral for another three to five years.“Here in the South, we’re supplying 30% more than demand.”It’s different all across the country. In the Northeast, they still aren’t building enough for demand. The West is barely getting there. Here in the South, we’re doing better than anybody else. We’re supplying about 30% more than demand. However, we still have a lot of catching up to do, and while we’re catching up, more and more buyers are coming onto the market.If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me. If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email me today for a free consultation.",

Whether it’s because of a growing family or simply a wish to invest in a better property, people do this all of the time.Usually move up buyers have to find a home to move into before they can sell, and vice versa, so sometimes the transactions can get dicey. However, I have a lot of experience helping move up buyers, and there are a few things that can be done to have a seamless transaction.My advice to you right now is to focus on the purchase because inventory is low right now, so selling your home will be the easy part.“Focus on finding a home before selling.”In a normal market, you could use contingencies to sell your home, but right now, because of the low inventory, this may not work.Another option is to build a new home, so then you can have a slow move in and have plenty of time to sell your home.If you’re interested in moving up, please contact me and ask about my move up discount.

However, it does take 4-8 months to build a home, so if you’re in a hurry, it may not be your ideal option.When you buy a pre-owned home, it is a lot more cost-effective because you get a lot more home in terms of cost per sq. ft. New homes are often more expensive, but you have total control over the price when you’re picking materials and amenities.“Building a new home requires a lot of time and money.”However, sometimes with resale properties, the previous owners have already customized the home and barred the expense, so you have to pay nothing for those upgrades!If you’re thinking of building a new home, I would advise you to use a Realtor when you’re working with a builder, and I would be glad to represent you.As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me in regards to Mansfield real estate.",

        "content": "The market here in Mansfield is extremely active and we’re seeing a lot of multiple offers happening. This is why I thought I would shed some light on this topic, as a lot of my clients have been asking about it. There are different strategies that buyers and sellers can take when faced with this problem, and I’m here to tell you about them.“Sometimes the best offer is the one that has the highest likelihood of closing.”The important thing to know as a buyer is that your competition will be fierce, but this doesn’t mean that you don’t stand a chance. Sometimes a personalized offer can help push you to the top of the list. Sellers are always more comfortable choosing a buyer that they can relate to, and one that they know will be taking good care of their home. Writing a note to them explaining why you want the property can help a lot, but I’ve also filmed videos with families, and that can be helpful too.If you’re a seller in a multiple offer situation, it’s important to have patience as we expose your property to a large audience of buyers. When you do get multiple offers, you want to ensure that the offers are from pre-qualified buyers, because they’re serious about purchasing a home. Cash offers are also good, but you just want to see proof of funds. However, sometimes cash is not the most important, sometimes the best offer is the one that has the highest likelihood of closing. Every seller has a different motivation, so sometimes it’s also just a matter of what works f",

        "content": "People always ask me how the local real estate market is performing, and the answer always depends on whether you’re buying, selling, or investing.If you’re a seller, you’ll find that now is a great time to put your home on the market. Buyer demand is high and inventory is low, so you stand to make a good profit if you get your home on the market now. Just remember, it needs to be priced correctly and in good condition.If you’re looking to buy a home, now is also a good time to do so. Interest rates are at historic lows (below 4%) and there are a lot of excellent loan products available. It’s more affordable to buy a home right now than it has been in a very long time. It’s a lot cheaper to pay a mortgage right now than it is to pay monthly rent, so if you’ve thought about purchasing a home, then now may be the time to pull the trigger. This is also true because interest rates are currently on the rise, so your affordability may drop if you wait to buy.“You have a really great opportunity to capitalize on a move-up home sale.”Investors will have a little tougher time flipping homes, but rental rates are increasing so you may find comfort in that fact. I would recommend investing in rental homes over properties that you’re just going to flip.Overall, inventory is extremely low in our area. If your home is worth more than $200K, there is only about 1 month supply of inventory. If your home is worth less than $200K then you will find that there is only 1-2 weeks worth of inventory. This means that you have a really great opportunity to capitalize on a move-up home sale.If you’d like any assistance buying, selling, or investing in a new home, then please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be very happy to assist you!",
