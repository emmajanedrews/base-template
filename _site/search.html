        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For our a look ahead at our spring market, we’ll focus separately on the Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee areas and talk about how inventory levels are shaking out in three distinct price ranges.The first of those price ranges is the first-time buyer market, which typically represents homes priced up to $250,000. In both Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee, there is no new construction in this level of inventory. What’s really interesting, though, is that the number of active listings and the number of pending listings in both communities are identical. This tells us that though first-time  buyers may not be able to build a new home, the inventory that is coming on the market is moving at a nice clip.The second price range is the move-up buyer market, which is roughly between $250,000 and $400,000. This market is slightly different in both Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee in that there is some new construction inventory. However, existing inventory tends to pend or sell faster in this range because move-up buyers look for value, and you can often find better value in the existing market where home features like decks, patios, gutters, and window treatments are already done for you.North of $400,000, it’s an entirely different ball game. There is a lot more pending inventory and an extensive amount of active inventory because there are fewer buyers.“Pay attention to prices as more inventory comes on the market.”What does this mean moving forward in 2018? It means first-time buyers will predominantly stick to existing inventory. Above the $400,000 mark, there will be a lot of new construction inventory and existing inventory because we’re already in a low-inventory market in general.Considering inventory levels are so low, make sure you make a smart buying decision if you are a homebuyer. By that we mean pay attention to prices as more inventory comes on the market during spring and summer because they may get inflated. Also, remember that interest rates are still low and very competitive.As always, whatever you do, make sure you have an experienced agent on your side. If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why is it important to get a look at your home’s current market value, and what are the benefits of knowing that information?This is a good time of year for people to assess their current home. We can come out, take a look, and give you an idea of what your home’s value might be.People often like to ask us about what they can work on to improve the value of their home while maintaining the property and keeping it up to date. We can help determine what you need to do to keep your home in good condition.Even if you’re not selling in the next couple of months—or the next couple of years—it’s good to have a baseline of the market value of your home so that you can make a decision based on its value in the future.“It’s important to know your market value because our market is constantly changing.”It’s also good to understand your market value because of all the changes that happen in our area. Our market sees a lot of new construction, commercial growth, and farms being bought and sold that may soon be developed.As a result of all this change, people want to know, “Is it a good time to sell? Are market values going up or down?” Knowing where your home currently sits in terms of market value will give you a sense of comfort, as well as an idea of what your future home sale could look like.If you would like a home valuation, or if you have any other questions, just give us a call or send us an email.

As a result, spring is a common time for buyers to enter the market.However, buyer traffic is very heavy in the springtime. In low inventory markets, some of our listings may get as many as 25 to 30 showings over the course of one weekend in the spring. As a buyer looking to buy a home, particularly a first home, it can be intimidating to buy a home in the spring. It may even feel hopeless at times.The benefit of trying the market in an off-peak season is that the buyer is able to explore what’s out there without all of the competition. Shopping for a home in off-peak seasons like fall and winter also increases the likelihood that you will find a home.“You will be able to explore your options without all of the competition.”If you are searching for a home this winter, we recommend that you get written verification from sellers regarding certain winterization projects.After all, the AC unit should be shut off and the sprinkler system should be winterized, which means the inspector won’t be able to test them in the winter. Just ask for the seller to confirm that those things were working before they were properly shut down in the fall.If you have any questions about buying a home in the winter market, just give us a call or send us an email.

The market did slow down in August as families wrapped up vacations and went back to school. That slowdown can often transition into early September, so we do see the market pick up again in late September, October, and into Thanksgiving.So, if you are thinking of buying or selling a home, the market is still active during this key part of the season.We’d also like to touch on some new construction development that’s been going on lately.If you drive down County Road 42 in Prior Lake, you’ll see a lot of activity. Pulte Homes and Lennar Homes are clearing a lot of trees for new developments on the south side of 42. There will be single-family homes and townhomes.“The market does pick up again from late September.”Lennar and Summit Preserve will also be building single-family homes and townhomes. M/I Homes, formerly known as Hans Hagen, will also be building some properties around that 42 corridor.In Shakopee on County Road 16, Lennar is also building a lot of homes. We’re talking hundreds of lots. Although there is a lot of building going on, those properties are not included in our current inventory numbers.Next year though, you will see some big changes in inventory. There will be a lot of lots available and the market will be pretty competitive.All of that said, this actually could be a very good time to look at buying or building a home. The fall season is still a good time to be in the market. A lot of people are busy with their kids’ sports and activities. If that’s not taking up a lot of your time, then now is a good time to look at the homes that are available because you will have less competition.If you have any questions about our current market, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "There are two components to representation in a new construction transaction. The first is your representation during the actual purchase of the site of the new home. The second is when you have a home to sell in order to purchase a new construction home.When you buy a new build site, it’s important to know that the agent at the model home represents the seller. In this case, the seller is the builder. It’s important that the consumer realizes that the agent represents the builder’s best interests.As a buyer, if you want to make an offer on a new build property, working with a buyer’s agent can be very important. We’ve seen a lot of people fall in love with all of the beautiful, shiny things that new construction has to offer. In terms of resale, it’s important to work with an agent who works in the existing resale market to figure out what you can do to make the home of value to others in the future should you ever decide to sell it.For example, we often see people put stainless steel appliances and granite countertops above a third garage stall in terms of importance. If you’re building a $500,000 house, the third stall is just an expectation at that point.“An independent agent will represent your best interests over the builder’s.”The second component of representation is when you are building a new home but have an existing home that you need to sell first.Oftentimes, the builder won’t begin digging on your new home until you have your existing home under contract. Something to consider when evaluating which agent to sell your home is whether they are independent or work with the builder.An independent agent may have more of a voice for you in terms of your unique situation. They will work to get the best price possible for your home, as well as the best possible terms. An agent who works with the builder is focused on selling your existing home so that you can get into your new house.Ultimately, whether you work with an independent agent or an agent attached to the builder depends on your unique situation.If you have any questions about buying a new construction property, just give us a call or send us an email.

This is a very lengthy, 10-page document that goes through everything a prospective buyer will need to know about the condition of the property.The full disclosure form will ask about the age of the roof and if the mechanical systems and appliances are in working order. If you have a private well or septic system, those need to be disclosed as well.“If you’ve done a radon test in the past, you need to disclose the results.”A couple of years ago, our state added a radon disclosure piece as well. One of the most common questions we get from prospective sellers is, “Do I need a radon test?”The state of Minnesota does not require a radon test prior to selling your home. However, if you’ve had a test completed in the past, you do need to give the results of the test to any potential buyers of the property.There will be a radon warning statement attached to the disclosure statement.

Even if you plan on listing during the winter, having a nice, green shot of your yard to use for supplemental purposes is a nice touch.“Come out of the gate competitively in terms of price.”Third, come out of the gate competitively in terms of price, because the window of time before the new year period is limited.Lastly, have patience. There are typically fewer buyers out and about during an off-peak market, but those who do come out tend to be more serious about buying.If you have any questions about selling in an off-peak market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

This was complicated and cumbersome because people would get these timelines confused.Minnesota has simplified this process by setting a timeline for the entire inspection contingency. This includes any inspections, repair requests, and bids for the work that needs to be done on those repairs.“There is no automatic cancellation specified in the purchase agreement anymore.”The other big change is that if the buyer lets the inspection contingency ride out all the way through without any agreement on repairs from the seller, they can move forward with the house—there is no automatic cancellation specified in the purchase agreement.What kind of tests does the inspection contingency cover? Basically, any tests the buyer needs to conduct to satisfy themselves that the home meets their standards.The new inspection contingency also provides access to the buyer to the attic or crawl space of the house. In the past, this was an issue because buyers wanted to get into this area for their inspection but sellers didn’t want to break the seal on their attic. This new inspection contingency verbiage grants that access to the buyer so they can complete their inspection.If you have any questions about inspections, what’s going on in our market, or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

There’s a common misconception that in order to get a house, you have to put 20% down.These days, this simply isn’t the case. In today’s market, you have several options available to you.“In today’s market, you have several loan options.”The VA loan, for example, allows veterans to go in with zero down. For people buying their first home, a good option is the FHA loan—which allows you to put as little as 3.5% down.Even in the case of a conventional loan you can put either 3% or 5% down. Gift funds, too, can apply.To work with Shane and his team, the first thing you’ll need to do is fill out an application.

        "content": "What is the Zillow Zestimate?Zillow has an algorithm called the Zestimate that comes up with a home’s value. There are a few things to watch out for when finding your Zestimate.Although Zillow’s exact formula is unknown, we do know that the Zestimate pulls data from tax records, past sales, and past appreciation rates. Unfortunately, Zestimates often tend to be inaccurate.Recently, Zillow said that the Zestimate is off 6.9% on average from the actual sales price of a home. In our market, Zestimates can be off anywhere from 7% to 10%. Most of the time, Zestimates are off by even more than that. In fact, I looked at our house today and the Zestimate is 20% higher than our home’s true market value.The Zestimate is not the only valuation model out there. In addition to online, automated home valuation services (which also tend to be inaccurate), there is the tax assessed value, which is what your county or municipality does. They consider your building versus the value of the land.“The market value used by Realtors is the most accurate value of your home.”There is also the appraised value. While most people tend to look at the appraised value as an accurate, reliable source, it’s important to keep in mind that the appraised value is based on one person’s opinion on one particular day.Realtors rely on the market value, which is the most accurate value of your property. We use current data, previous data, and future projections to figure out what your home is worth. We also consider things like the location of your lot, your view, the neighborhood, how busy the road is, and what updates you have made to the home. Online valuation tools don’t know about the condition of your home, and appraisers don’t always examine all of those factors, either.If you’re curious to learn more about Zestimates, here’s a fun project: Go to Zillow and type in your address. Even if your home is not on the market and you’re not even thinking about selling, Zillow will give you a Zestimate. Then, give us a call or send us an email. We’ll run some numbers and figure out just how accurate your Zestimate really is.Even if you’re not looking to sell your home, it can be fun to know where you stand in the market.So, reach out to us with your Zestimate or any other real estate questions that you may have.

We do that through other agents and brokers, our internal systems, our local database, and a tool in the MLS called reverse prospecting.How does reverse prospecting work? When we have a listing, we’re able to search for other agents who have buyers at that price point. Then, we can communicate with those other agents regarding our listings.“The MLS is the best place to market your home online.”That brings us to our pre-MLS database called Network One. This is an in-house database where we can access homes that are going to be on the market but aren’t quite ready yet. This is a great place for sellers who need to get some work done on the home, like refinishing hardwood floors or painting.Network One allows other agents to see properties that are about to hit the market and lets them know exactly when it will be available for sale. That way, those agents can inform those buyers that there is another home coming on the market soon.This tool is not a substitute for the MLS. The MLS is the best place to market your home online. However, Network One is a great way for sellers in the preparation phase to get exposure for their home before officially hitting the market.If you would like to know more about our pre-market MLS or our database of buyers and sellers, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "What’s happening in our local real estate market?If you compare pricing from 2016 to 2017, home prices have gone up 5% in the metro area and across Scott County.Inventory in the metro area is down 16%, while inventory in Scott County is down almost 17.5%. So, what does the absorption rate look like?The absorption rate is how long it would take to sell all of the homes currently on the market if no other homes came on the market. An absorption rate of five to seven months is considered a balanced market, while anything under five months is a seller’s market. In the metro and Scott County, the absorption rate is in the upper twos, which is even lower than the three months of inventory we had last year.However, the absorption rate is different in each price point. Homes under $350,000 have an absorption rate of 1.7 months. Homes over $350,000 have an absorption rate of five to six months, so there is a more balanced market in those higher price points.“Inventory is extremely low under $350,000.”What does that mean for our market?If you are trying to buy a home under $250,000, there are a lot of multiple offer situations. Homes priced between $300,000 and $350,000 will move quickly and may also draw multiple offers.For example, last week our buyers made an offer on a home that was priced at $209,000. Even though our offer was $30,000 over the listing price, there were many other offers on the table, and ours was not the highest one.This is a good market for move-up buyers though. You can sell your $300,000 home in a seller’s market and find a $400,000 home in a balanced market. If you are trying to downsize, though, and you need to sell your current home first, that can be a lot more difficult. There is extremely low inventory in the rambler/townhome demographic.Another important note on inventory is that there are a lot of new construction developments out there offering homes over $450,000. Those new construction homes aren’t on the MLS, so those homes do skew the market stats just a bit.Finally, keep in mind that different neighborhoods are in different markets.
