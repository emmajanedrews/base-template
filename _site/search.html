This is a topic that raises a lot of confusion, which is why I’m here to clear up the subject.One of the main things people ask is, “How much do I need to put down?”The truth is that it all depends. We need to ask ourselves if we can meet your financial budget, if we can meet your monthly payment requirements, and if we can buy the house you have in mind with the funds you have on hand.“The amount people put down varies a lot more than some might tend to believe.”Most of our clients put down between 3% and 10%, but some put down more and others put down less. The amount people put down varies a lot more than some might tend to believe.We even have programs available that allow you to buy a home for nothing down at all.Ultimately, we’d love to walk you through the process and determine what route is best for you.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Home remodeling is as hot as it’s ever been. Here are five projects that bring the best return on investment.Home remodeling is hotter than ever.According to researchers at Harvard University, remodeling investment is up 6% over last year and now makes up a $324 billion market.According to a survey of remodelers and real estate professionals, there are five remodeling projects that offer the best returns:1. Your kitchen. Kitchen remodeling can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. However, to maximize your return, keep your investment to under 20% of the value of your home—as is recommended by surveyed real estate professionals. The outcome? A whopping 85% return on your investment.2. Your bathroom. A thorough bath remodeling project can cost up to $20,000. However, not only will it pay for itself, it should give you an added 80% return.3. Your deck. Replacing your deck can cost you anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size. The expected benefit will be similar to a bathroom remodeling project—around an 80% return for a fresh, new deck.4. Your siding. Fading or worn-out siding can turn off potential buyers before they even step foot in your home. Replacing old siding will make it much easier to sell your home, and in addition, it should give you an 80% return on an investment of around $10,000.5. Your windows. New windows can mean greater energy efficiency, increased thermal and acoustic comfort, and a more modern look. Homebuyers are well aware of this, and they are willing to pay accordingly. That’s why a typical window replacement should yield at least a 70% return on your investment.“Some will make more sense for your home than others.”Clearly, some of them will make more sense for your home than others. If you’re considering selling your home, then just one of these projects could add tens of thousands of dollars to the price you’ll be able to get.If you have any questions or want additional advice about which remodeling projects make sense for you, give me a call or send me an email. We can discuss all the details and I can give you an accurate estimate of what these projects could cost, and how to go about financing them. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "title": "How the Feds Recent Rate Hike Impacts Our Market",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The Fed’s recent rate hike shouldn’t have any significant impact on our market. In fact, it might actually stimulate it.On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.“These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.”Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help.",

        "content": "Today I want to inform you about how Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of mortgages, recently introduced three new rules that will affect those with student debt.If you have a student loan or you are a cosigner on one, I have some good new for you.Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of mortgages, recently introduced three new rules that will affect those with student debt.These new rules can make it easier to get a mortgage, and they can make it easier to pay off your (or your kids’) student loans.The first change is for those on income-based repayment plans, where having a high debt-to-income ratio is the No. 1 reason for not being approved for a mortgage.Fannie Mae previously used a very conservative 1% of the total loan instead of the actual monthly payment. This can drastically lower your debt-to-income ratio and give you a much better chance of qualifying for a mortgage.Some folks are lucky enough to have their student debt paid by their parents or even by their employer. The thing is, Fannie Mae didn’t take this into account when calculating the debt-to-income ratio. That’s the second new change.If your employer or your parents have been paying off your student debt and you can show evidence of this for the past 12 months, then this debt won’t be counted in your debt-to-income ratio. This makes it more likely you will qualify for a mortgage.“If you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should.”If you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should. Rates are still at a historical low, and lots of great houses have recently come on the McKinney market.Fannie Mae also makes it possible to refinance your mortgage for more than the value of your home. Normally, there is a 0.25% fee that applies to any cash you take out in this way.The third big change is that Fannie Mae will now waive that fee when you use this cash to pay off a student loan.This applies whether the loan is yours, or you’re a cosigner. If the mortgage rate is significantly lower than the student loan rate, it can make sense to refinance in this way, and the new rule makes it cheaper to do so.If you need help understanding these new guidelines to see whether they’re right for you, or you have questions about putting them into practice, get in touch with me. I’ll be glad to help.I hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "Today, I want to share with you all the options you have for an affordable down payment as a homebuyer.What’s the biggest obstacle to homeownership?According to a recent survey, “saving enough for a down payment” comes at the top of the list. A whopping 55% of prospective homebuyers cited this as their main stumbling block.And with the continuing growth of home prices, things aren’t getting any easier. In fact, homeownership rates reached a 20-year low last November.It wasn’t always like this.A decade ago, many lenders were offering easy, no-money-down mortgages.However, after the financial crisis, mortgage standards have become more restrictive. A typical mortgage now requires a 20% down payment.“55% cited the lack of a down payment as their main stumbling block.”Here’s the good news.If you have decent credit and a steady income, you might be qualified for a number of specialized programs that require no or very little down payment. Here are a few of the top options.First, there’s the USDA loan, which is valid for homes in certain regions, such as rural and suburban areas.With zero money down and lenient credit requirements, the USDA loan can be a great choice for many homeowners.Second, there’s the VA loan, which you can apply for if you or your spouse served in a branch of the military.It’s possibly the most generous zero-money-down mortgage because of low interest rates and low closing costs.Third, there’s the FHA loan. It does require a 3.5% down payment — still drastically more achievable than the 20% required for a conventional mortgage.Finally, there are a number of credit unions and first-time homebuyer programs that might apply to your particular situation.There’s one important thing you should know.If you get one of these no-money-down mortgages, chances are good you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance, which can drive up your monthly payments.Fortunately, private mortgage insurance will disappear after your mortgage balance is under 80%. Also, the money you do pay will be tax deductible in most cases.In short, there are lots of options to make owning a home a reality for you, even if you haven’t saved up tens of thousands of dollars.If you’re considering buying a home, give me a call and we can discuss your options.Buying a McKinney Home?

Luckily, whether you’re a buyer or a seller, there are steps you can take to ensure this doesn’t happen.Why is choosing the right lender critical if you want to close on time?For one thing, statistics show that not choosing the right lender can be disastrous. Every month, mortgage services provider Ellie Mae produces a report they call the “Origination Insight Report.” In this report, they track and pull all kinds of data from all the lenders who use their software to process loans. We’re talking millions of loans.What does the data from the latest report tell us?Firstly, it tells us that the average numbers of days it takes to close a loan from the application to the closing is 46 days. That’s way too many! Secondly, it tells us that only 74% of purchase loans that are submitted end up closing. That means that one out of every four deals falls through, or 25% of the people end up having to put down earnest money, lose their inspection costs, and possibly lose their appraisal fee.“Don’t end up as a cautionary statistic.”What can you do to make sure you don’t end up becoming one of these statistics?If you’re a home buyer, start the pre-qualification process as early as possible. Get your documentation in order and choose a lender that has a track record of success.If you’re a seller, do what you can to verify the pre-approval. Check out things like what kind of lender the buyer is using, how much they’re putting down, and how many days they need for the financing contingency.If you or anyone you know has questions about the mortgage process or about real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to call us or visit our website.

        "content": "As a homeowner, there are many ways you can save money without refinancing.First, you can have your conventional mortgage insurance removed. If you bought a house in the last five years, there is a good chance you can remove mortgage insurance because home values have gone up 8% to 10%.You should also check on your home insurance. Insurance rates change all the time. For instance, if a company with higher exposure in certain areas gets hit by a storm, their rates will go up. A company with less exposure would probably keep the same rates despite the storm, giving you good coverage for less money. Switching insurance companies could save you a lot of money in the long run.“Home Insurance rates change all the time, so shop around for a better one.”If you’re happy with your insurance, consider checking your utility rates. You don’t have much choice when it comes to things like gas, water, and trash. However, you can save money on your electricity, phone, cable, or internet bill. You can research different rates on your own by checking PowerToChoose.org or we can hook you up with a free concierge service that will shop the rates and get you the best program.Finally, file that homestead exemption to save 15% to 20% on your property taxes. You have to be the owner of record on January 1st and you have three months to file the exemption. Once that exemption has been filed, it’s good for that year and all the other years you spend in that house.As you can see, refinancing is not the only way you can save money on your house.

			<p>Hello, My name is Rob Spring with the Spring Mortgage Team at AmeriFirst Financial of Texas. I am a License Loan Originator and we are a local Mortgage Lender and Broker. Our office is just off the Historic Downtown Square in McKinney, Texas.
I have been in Mortgage and Real Estate for 15 years. I’ve seen the ups and downs – The Mortgage World has changed quite a bit over the years. I’ve worked for the big bank, the Mom and Pop, ran branches and teams - I’ve found my forever home with AmeriFirst.</p>
