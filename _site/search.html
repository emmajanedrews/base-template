        "content": "Frustrated homebuyers in the Central Iowa market may be able to use the backup offer strategy to their advantage.Want to sell your Central Iowa home? Get a free home value reportWant to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLSA lot of Central Iowa homebuyers are frustrated right now. Certain segments of the market are on fire, and they aren’t able to get into homes fast enough. As a result, they feel they don’t have very many homes to choose from.There may still be hope if you use the backup offer strategy.In the past, once a home went under contract, there’s very little chance for a competing buyer to get their foot in the door. Once the seller had chosen another buyer’s offer, typically they made it to the closing table with no problems.However, in those super hot segments of the market, we are seeing a higher fallout rate. Why is that?First of all, many buyers feel like they need to make a quick decision in those market segments or they will lose the home. As a result, it’s very common for people to make offers on a home without fully vetting the property to make sure it’s the right home for them.“IF THE FIRST DEAL FALLS APART, THE SELLER HAS YOUR OFFER TO FALL BACK ON.”Secondly, multiple offer situations really drive up the price of a home. Buyers then have very high expectations of how that home will perform during the inspection. Buyers and sellers have a hard time agreeing what condition the property should be in, which has led to a number of deals falling apart after the home inspection.Having a backup offer in place puts pressure on that first offer. If for any reason that deal falls apart, the seller would much rather go to your offer than go through the hassle of putting the home on the market again. Plus, since you have a backup offer in place, the seller may be more willing to let the first deal fall apart.Not all agents can navigate the ins and outs of the backup offer, but we work hard at honing our skills in order to give our buyers the edge in this competitive market.If you have any questions about this strategy or anything else, just give us a call or send us an email. Remember, if we choose your question for one of our upcoming videos, you’ll get a free subscription to Better Homes and Gardens magazine.We look forward to hearing from you!",

Get a free home value reportWant to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLSThe central Iowa real estate market is pretty hot right now, which creates unique challenges for buyers and sellers. For sellers, it’s incredibly important that you choose an agent who has experience with multiple offer situations, as they are common in our market.When you receive multiple offers on your home, how do you know which is the best one? There are a few things you should consider:1. Price. Obviously, we want to maximize your equity and get you the best price available for your home. Our expertise really comes in handy when it comes to looking at the full terms of the offer, because the offer with the highest price is not necessarily the best one for your interests.2. What kind of time frame are they looking for? How flexible will the buyer be on possession? As a seller, that can make or break your ability to get into your next property, so it’s important to know that up front.“THE OFFER WITH THE HIGHEST PRICE IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST ONE FOR YOU.”3. What kind of contingencies does this buyer have that might cause stumbling blocks in the process? Inspections, HOA documents, or having a survey completed are just a few examples of little things that might seem irrelevant, especially if the buyer is offering a high price. However, each of those contingencies gives the buyer a chance to renegotiate after they’ve won the deal, which could make the transaction unpleasant for you.4. What are the financing terms? We love cash offers, but cash isn’t always better than financing. Someone who has a loan commitment is just as important as someone who has cash. The fortunate thing about working with an experienced agent is we know what to expect from different lenders. We know if a buyer is working with a reputable lender or a lender that we’ve had issues with in the past.Ultimately, we will sit down, look at all your different options, and work together to make sure that your needs are being met and that you choose the best offer possible.If you have any other questions about selling your home in our current market, just give us a call.

Can you really live with less space? A lot of empty nesters realize that they don’t need as much space or as many rooms but when it comes down to it, a lot of them aren’t ready to give things up to fit in a smaller space. If you’re not ready to give up some of the luxuries of having a large home, downsizing doesn’t make sense right now.“CAN YOU REALLY LIVE WITH LESS SPACE?”2. Are you ready for a truly lower-maintenance lifestyle? Going from a large home to a condo or townhome leaves you with less yard work, less maintenance, and less square footage to take care of. If that sounds like an exciting change in your life, it’s something for you to consider.3. What kind of equity position do you have on your home?

Get a free home value reportWant to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLSWhether you are a home buyer or a seller, one thing that we always think is a good idea to include in your real estate transaction is a home warranty.What is a home warranty? It’s an agreement with a warranty provider to cover the mechanical systems and moving parts of your home for a period of time. Warranties usually last up to one year after the closing.How do home warranties benefit buyers? The biggest benefit is that it significantly reduces the potential for large, out-of-pocket expenses after the home purchase. When we consider everything that is included in the home—appliances, the HVAC, electrical systems, and plumbing to name a few—the peace of mind that comes from knowing that a provider will cover any issues is critically important.“WARRANTIES USUALLY LAST UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE CLOSING.”How does a home warranty work? Whenever you experience an issue during that warranty coverage period, you’ll contact the warranty provider rather than your local plumber or handyman. They will connect you with one of their preferred providers and come out to look at the home. There will be a service charge up front, which you will know when you have the warranty coverage in place. They will then repair the item, and if they’re not able to do so, then they will replace it for you.How does a home warranty benefit sellers? Most warranty providers provide free listing coverage during the time that your home is on the market. It is also a wonderful way to eliminate your liability after the closing in the event that anything goes wrong for that buyer.Our personal warranty provider is HWA Warranty. They have an awesome platinum warranty that covers the home for 13 months, rather than the 12 months covered by most providers. We have had a lot of success with it and think that it is well worth the cost to provide our buyers with peace of mind after they have purchased their largest investment.If you have any other questions about how a home warranty can benefit you or anything else related to real estate in Central Iowa, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "There tend to be a few common costs that buyers overlook when they purchase their home. Today, I have a full list of these items that will help buyers avoid getting surprised by extra costs.Want to sell your Central Iowa home? Get a free home value reportWant to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLSWhen you buy a home, there are some hidden costs that you should be aware of.While the home shopping process can be exciting, certain costs tend to sneak up on buyers. Here are some key tips to help you be fully informed when buying:1. Property taxes. Of your monthly house payments, property taxes are the item that can fluctuate the most during the lifetime of your mortgage. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to the assessed value of your home and the tax rates in the area you chose. If the seller you’re buying from did a great job with home renovations but they’re not reflected in the assessed value, be prepared for the potential of your property taxes jumping up in the next year or so.2. Insurance costs. Many people have a general idea of homeowners insurance based on the value of the home they buy, but some special considerations can greatly affect the costs. For example, acreages that are long distances from a fire station can cause the cost to go up exponentially. Another would be having an in-ground swimming pool. If you have any special circumstances, be sure to check what your insurance agent’s rate is.“MANY BUYERS FORGET TO CONSIDER EXTRA COSTS FOR A NEW HOME, LIKE WINDOW TREATMENTS AND INSTALLING LANDSCAPING.”3. Utility bills. Here in Iowa when we go from five below to 105 degrees over the course of the year, we really use our heating and cooling systems. It’s important to get a sense of the cost of running and maintaining them, and it’s very easy for us to get a 12- to 24-month average from a provider. Having that knowledge up front really helps you prepare.4. Maintenance costs. We all know there will be maintenance involved—it’s part of the fun of owning a new place. There are, however, some things people don’t think about as much. Older homes, for example, will have a great, mature landscape with lots of trees and plants, but it can be costly to maintain with watering and other maintenance costs. With newer homes, people often overlook things like the cost of window treatments, landscaping installation, and all the things you need to buy because no one has lived there before.All these items are very easy to overcome; it’s all about having the knowledge up front instead of getting surprised down the road.If you have any other questions about the costs of homeownership or you’re thinking about buying or selling a central Iowa home, just give me a call.

Along with that inspection, we offer a home warranty through HWA for the first 13 months after the buyer has purchased.This program has provided amazing peace of mind for our sellers. We find over and over again that one of the most stressful parts of the home selling process isn’t having your home on the market or obtaining that accepted offer; on the contrary, it’s actually all the stuff that happens afterward. This is because after you hit that inspection period, there’s really a second negotiation that occurs.“OUR PROGRAM PROVIDES PEACE OF MIND AND NEGOTIATING POWER TO OUR SELLERS.”We put you as a seller in a position of power instead of weakness when it comes to these negotiations.

I have gone over a few on my blog already. Today I am discussing Realtor service fees and what they cover.People often call our office wanting to know how much we charge. That is totally understandable; after all, if you want to calculate how much it will cost to sell your home, you should compare the prices of different Realtors.However, it’s important that you understand exactly what each Realtor is offering for that cost. There are many different providers in our market that have different charges and fees. Here at the Misty Soldwisch team, I can tell you that we do not have the lowest cost in the metro area, but there is a good reason for that.We feel that it is important to make sure that we understand what your goals are in selling. We want to know what you want your bottom line to be. As part of our service fees, we will give you advice and strategies to maximize your sales price.“FLAT RATE BROKERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO NET YOU AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN.”We have worked again and again with sellers whose homes failed to sell because they worked with a discount or flat rate broker. Through our advice, we reposition the home at a higher price and help these sellers sell the home because of all of the different things we offer as part of our service fees and marketing. Ultimately, the seller walks away with more money than they anticipated.Part of these service fees go to our marketing and our expertise, and another part goes to compensate the buyer’s broker. As part of the Des Moines Association of Realtors, we participate in the MLS, which shows other agents that we are willing to cooperate with them. They bring buyers to your home and we compensate them through the fees you pay us.As I said, Realtor service fees are only part of the cost of selling your home.

Search all the homes on the MLSOne thing that makes Iowa really unique when selling real estate is the fact that we are one of the few states in the country that utilizes abstracting.What is an abstract? If you closed on a home in the past, you may recall that someone handed you a thick, legal-sized binder filled with all sorts of old papers and information, labeled “abstract.” Attorneys will tell you to guard these documents with your life because they’re so expensive to replace.“IT WILL COST BETWEEN $300 AND $500 TO UPDATE THE ABSTRACT.”When you go to sell your home, you’ll need to update that abstract. We’ll send that abstract to a local abstractor in the county in which your property is held, they will update it, then ship it to whoever the buyer is using as a title opinion attorney. That attorney will then look over the abstract and all of the information that’s contained in it, including the history of the property, which will go back all the way to when the land was deeded over from the U.S. government. They will look for any clouds on the title that need to be cleared.The cost of updating your abstract will be somewhere around $300 to $600, depending on the county that you live in, how long it’s been since you last had the abstract updated, as well as other variables depending on your specific real estate situation.In other states, title insurance will usually take the place of an abstract.
