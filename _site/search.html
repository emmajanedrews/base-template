        "content": "The first impression your home leaves a buyer with is the most important. When we bring a buyer through a home, we have one good shot at showing it in its best possible light. Here are a few home staging tips you can use to capture that light when it comes time to sell.It’s important to know that buyers really care about kitchens and bathrooms. It’s also important to know that before they even make their way to those rooms, 75% of buyers have already made up their mind about a home by the time they get out of the car. Observe your home as a potential buyer, and pay close attention to its curb appeal. Note how it feels to walk up the driveway to your house to get an idea of what buyers see. Is there fresh paint? Does it smell nice?“WE ARE THE NO. 1 TEAM IN CHARLESTON.”Here’s the good news: Our market is on fire. Inventory is down a whopping 17%, which means buyers have fewer homes to choose from. Because of this, homes can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days to sell. During this period, we want to present your home in its best possible light to the buyers on the market. Because we are the No. 1 team in Charleston, we have the ability to bring our technology, our resources, and our marketing to you to ensure that your home sells in the shortest time period and for the most amount of money.If you have any questions for us about home staging or anything else related to buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Which improvements and renovations can you do to your home to maximize its value?First, keep your renovations moderate. When you’re attempting to do a renovation or an upgrade, ask yourself one question: Will the majority of buyers coming through this home appreciate this renovation, or will I have to do it again if I decide to sell this home at a later date?Second, pay attention to curb appeal. Your curb appeal creates the first impression of your home. In our office, we abide by something we call the three second rule. This means whenever we bring a buyer to a property, they will determine whether they want to seriously consider purchasing that property or not within the first three seconds of pulling in the driveway. Spend some money on landscaping and other areas out front to make your home more inviting for any prospective buyers.“SPEND THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MONEY IN KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS.”Third, have as much hardwood flooring in your home as you can. Buyers love neutral, hardwood floors. If you can’t afford to install hardwood floors, make your current flooring as clean and neat as possible.Lastly, spend the majority of your money in kitchens and bathrooms. These are the places in the home where you’ll get your best return on investment. You can typically achieve a two-to-one return on investment, meaning you’ll get $2 in return on the sale of your home for every $1 you spend.If you have any questions about how to maximize your home’s value or you’re thinking about buying or selling a house, feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "Are you a pet owner looking to sell their home? If so, there are four rules you need to know.      Remove the pets from the home. I know it’s a challenge, but when I bring a buyer into your home I want to show it off in the best light possible. A cat or dog following a buyer around the house might make it difficult for them see all of the features that your home has to offer.        Take a long look at the backyard. Make sure holes are filled in and pet toys are put away. I want a buyer to be able to envision having picnics or their kids playing in the backyard, so making sure it’s manicured is essential.  “ASK A FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR TO COME OVER TO SEE IF THEY NOTICE A SMELL.”      Eliminate any pet odors inside the home. I own a dog, so I understand that you might not always pick up on scents. Ask a friend or neighbor to come over to see if they notice a smell. If they do, we can install Glade plug-ins or have the carpets cleaned.        Get rid of any potential pet hair. Our goal is to have multiple showings with multiple buyers, so you need to vacuum before every showing. This makes sure a buyer with allergies doesn’t get a bad impression of your home.  If you have any questions about this topic, or if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.",

Over time, you’ll have to pay for maintenance and insurance. That’s why we recommend you pay between 25% and 35% of your household disposable income toward that mortgage payment.        Location, location, location: Think about school districts even if you don’t have kids. When the time comes to sell in the future, it’ll be easier if you’re in a positive school district.  “THINK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVEN IF YOU DON’T HAVE KIDS.”  Communicate about the top features of the home: During our free buyer consultation, we’ll get a list of features that you and anyone living in the home would like to have. Then, we compare the lists and merge them into one list of must-haves so we can find your dream home.If you have any other questions about preparing to buy your first home, give us a call or send us an email.

This is a testament to the market because the first quarter is typically one of the slowest quarters of the year. **So what does it all mean for the second quarter?“EVERYBODY WANTS TO MOVE DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THE KIDS ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND THE DAYS ARE LONGER.”Remember that even more people get their homes ready to go on the market at this time of year. They want to move during the summertime when the kids aren’t in school and they have more all-around flexibility, along with longer days. The real estate market typically has the highest turnover rate in the second and third quarters.However, it’s important to remember that all the people planning to move to Charleston are planning their move during this period. That’s why if you’re considering selling your house, now might be the absolute best time. We can help you figure out exactly what you need to do to get your house ready for sale because now might be a perfect time.If you’re thinking about selling your house or you have any other questions we can answer, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "I just got a report with all the latest statistics from the Charleston real estate market and I wanted to share some of the most important numbers with you. These five statistics paint a promising picture of our market and show just how far we’ve come since the recession.      New listings. Almost 23,000 new homes have come on the market in the last 12 months.        Home sales. How many homes were sold during the same time frame? Some of you may be under the impression that every home that comes on the market is selling. However, that’s not what’s happening in reality. Out of those 23,000 listings, only 17,700 sold. That means there are between 5,000 and 6,000 properties that failed to sell. Regardless of what you think about the market, I encourage you to make sure that your Realtor has a strong marketing plan in place to sell your home. That’s really the only way to guarantee a sale in this market.  “IT IS TAKING AN AVERAGE OF 11 SHOWINGS TO SELL A HOME.”      Median sale price. This is intriguing. During the recession, the median sale price was around $180,000. Today, it’s at $240,000. It’s increased by over $50,000 in the past five years, but there are people who still think their home won’t sell. If that’s the impression you’re under, I invite you to give us a call. If you tell us how much you owe and how much you’d like to sell for, we would be happy to give you our honest, professional opinion if that is doable.        Market time. How long does it take a home to sell on average? Over the past 12 months, the answer is 58 days.        Average showings. Finally, let’s look at the average number of showings it takes for a home to get an offer. Right now, homes are getting offers after an average of 11 showings.

That is exactly what I wanted to discuss today.The entity that sets interest rates, the Federal Reserve, meets on a quarterly basis. In 2016, they increased interest rates in two of their four meetings, including the one in December. They have predicted that this year they will raise rates in three out of the four meetings.Let’s just say they go up 1% from 4.5% to 5.5%, which is what many experts are predicting. Logic says that is still an amazingly low rate, and based on 20- and 30-year trends, it is. However, here is what that increase means for you specifically if you’re trying to buy a home.“THIS IS THE TIME TO BUY OR SELL BEFORE THEY GO UP.”If you get approved today for up to $300,000 at 4.5%, just a 1% increase will greatly affect your buying power. With a 5.5% rate, you would only be able to afford a $270,000 home and your mortgage payment will end up about the same as it would have been with a $300,000 home at 4.5%.If you’re trying to get the maximum amount of money possible out of your home sale, now might be a good time to consider putting your home on the market. There are a lot of buyers out there looking right now and the more potential eyeballs looking at your home, the better. On the flip side, if you plan on purchasing a new home in the near future, it is a good idea to take advantage of the money while it’s cheap and before rates go up.If you have any questions for me or if you are looking to buy or sell a home in Charleston, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Many times we see buyers who are ready to own a home but just don’t have the money for a down payment. Did you know you can buy a home with very little or even zero money down? Today I wanted to share the top four ways you can do this in the Charleston market.Since interest rates are low, it’s still a fantastic time to buy a house. These are the ways you can take advantage with little or no money down:      VA (veterans) loan: You can buy a home if you’re a veteran for 100% financing.        State Housing: This is a grant for your down payment. Depending on your income and the county you’re buying in, it could be repaid or it could be completely forgivable.  “STATE HOUSING IS A DOWN PAYMENT GRANT THAT CAN BE TOTALLY FORGIVABLE.”      USDA: This lets you buy a home in what’s considered a rural area. Many areas around Monk’s Quarter, Goose Creek, and Summerville are still considered rural because of lines that were drawn many, many years ago. This loan also lets you finance 100% of the price.        A gift fund from a relative or family member: This lets you buy a home with a conventional down payment, but you utilize it as a gift from a family member or relative that’s applied directly to the home purchase.At the end of the day, if you have about $1,200, we can get the seller of the home you want to buy to pay the majority of the closing costs. The $1,200 will allow you to get the property inspected and put down your earnest money so you can buy the home.  With a 620 or better credit score and gainful employment, we may be able to help you get into a home with little or no money down. If you have any questions about qualifying or you’re interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The first reason is that you build equity with each mortgage payment. Say you take out a mortgage for $200,000. Every time you make a payment, that $200,000 balance continues to drop and your equity increases. The second reason is that you enjoy many tax benefits by being a homeowner. At the end of the year when it’s time to file your taxes, the interest and other things you’ve paid can be deducted to release your tax burden.The third reason is that buying a home is actually cheaper than renting in the long term. Say that $200,000 mortgage we talked about has a $1,200 a month payment, and you have a friend who rents a $1,200 a month home. The following year, your mortgage payment will still be $1,200, but your friend’s rent is probably going to go up by $50 or $100 per month, and will continue to increase at that rate every single year. In 30 years, you’ll still be paying $1,200 a month, and your friend could be paying up to $4,000 in rent!“BUYING A HOME IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN RENTING.”The fourth reason to own a home rather than rent one is that you will establish a solid credit history. Every single time you make a mortgage payment on time, your credit score continues to rise, which helps you in other aspects of life like getting better rates on insurance, cell phone payments, and anything else that requires credit.Finally, homeownership is healthy for families and the community. Just think about what happens in a home – the word “homemaker” comes to mind. Family comes over for holidays, friends come over for a cookout, neighbors become closer, kids are raised in the home, and relationships get stronger. It’s truly a wonderful thing.If you have any questions about homeownership or you’re interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, give me a call or send me an email.

So far in 2016, 19,000 homes have been listed on the market and 14,000 of those have sold. A large percentage have sold, but there will always be homes that don’t sell for a variety of reasons. Whether it’s because they are priced too high, they’re unable to accommodate showings, or they simply go too long without an offer, not every home will sell.This year, the median price in Charleston is $239,000, a 5.7% jump from last year’s median price. Our average sale price is also up by around 4.5% to $320,000.Last year, we had about a five-month supply of inventory at this time. Right now, our supply is at 3.6 months. What we mean by this is that if no more new homes came on the market after now, it would take 3.6 months to sell all the homes on the market at the current rate homes are selling. Anything below five to six months is considered a seller’s market, so that’s what we are in right now in Charleston.“BUYERS ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO PAY FULL PRICE.”I do want to caution you that in this fourth quarter, we have seen a growing trend of buyers becoming a little reluctant to pay full price. However, a lot of people are taking their homes off the market right now before the holidays, so you have a window of opportunity to sell high now.If your home is eligible to be shown during the holidays, I recommend you get it on the market right now. You can get ahead of the January rush that will come and get your home under contract while there is less competition and more serious buyers.We are in a tremendous market for home sellers. If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking or buying or selling, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to come out to your home and give you a complimentary home valuation to show you what you could really sell for this holiday season. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

In fact, there are two ways.Say it’s tax refund time or Christmas, and you’ve come across a little extra money. **Did you know that if you make a 13th mortgage payment each year, you’ll knock eight years off of the life of your 30-year mortgage? **The second strategy is especially helpful for those who get paid on a bi-weekly basis. Instead of making a monthly mortgage payment, talk to your mortgage company about setting up bi-weekly payments on your mortgage. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, making half of your mortgage payment every two weeks rather than a full payment every month equates to making 26 half payments over the course of the year. Of course, that equates to 13 full payments a year instead of 12, which you would get by making one full payment per month.“BOTH OPTIONS WILL SAVE YOU THOUSANDS IN INTEREST!”Just like in the first scenario, you would knock eight years off of your 30-year mortgage.

A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!        An influx of millennials purchasing. We refer to this as “pent-up demand.” These are people who are now old enough to purchase a home after living with their parents or renting for longer than they wanted due to the previous recession. Their collective need to buy homes has caused the market to continue to boom.  “A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!”      Home values are up. Did you know that we’re in a 9% higher price point than we were a year ago? If you couldn’t previously sell your home, you may now be able to.        Interest rates are at an all-time low. If interest rates go up 1%, that cuts a buyer’s purchasing power by 10%. This means that if you own a home that’s worth $300,000 and interest rates rise by 1%, a potential buyer for that house that could’ve gotten approved at $300,000 can now only get approved for $270,000.

        "content": "Today I’m happy to be joined by Tommy Welch of 1st Class Painting &amp; Restoration to talk about the top three things you can do to get the most value for your home.It’s a great question, Tommy said, and provided a contractor’s perspective. First and foremost, (and yes, Tommy says he’s a bit biased) you’ve got to make sure your paint is solid and neutral. He loves a good hot pink or your daughter’s bright blue bathroom, but not when you’re selling your home. It’s not just important to be neutral, it’s important that the quality of the work is good, so hire a professional.Secondly, Tommy said, know that buyers go straight to kitchens and bathrooms when they view a house. You want the kitchen to be functional, clean, and open. If your flooring is up to date, you’re probably ahead of the curve. Take a few minutes and take a non-biased look at your kitchen and bathrooms to look for what stands out as needing to be fixed or updated.“These are game-changers when it comes to listing your house.”Lastly, don’t forget the outdoors. We live here in Charleston so we can spend 365 days a year outside, so spruce up your yard. Keep the lawn cut, get rid of overgrowth, and make sure fences and decks are properly sealed, clean, and safe. You want people viewing your home to walk outside and think “Wow! I can hang out here!”All these things aren’t just cost-effective, they’re game-changers when it comes to listing your house and making a move. Tommy would love to come out and give you a totally free estimate on any of these things. You can call him at 843-324-6006 or you can email him at Tommy@1stClassCharleston.com.",

        "content": "Today, I’m discussing the advantages and disadvantages of new construction and resale properties when buying in Charleston. Whenever we sit down with buyers for initial consultations, they often know whether they want an older or newer home.If you’re interested in an older home, typically it’ll be in a mature neighborhood with developed trees and larger yard sizes on average. Oftentimes, you’ll notice smaller kitchens and bathrooms compared to new construction developments.“You have the opportunity to choose your add-ons with new construction properties.”New construction includes full warranties, but sometimes the yard sizes are smaller and the neighborhoods aren’t fully matured. The surrounding community might still be in construction mode, even though your home has already been built. You have the opportunity to personally choose your add-ons, such as flooring, colors, and other features. Additionally, you have built-in equity to a recently built home; the value increased during construction, even though you’re not making payments.If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, reach out by phone or email. I’d be happy to help answer your questions and serve your local real estate needs!",
