        "content": "Have you heard the good news? We have a tremendous new VIP Buyer Program designed to reward buyers like you for choosing us to help you buy a home. Here’s what we’re offering.You can earn a $1,500 closing credit if you buy a property from us that’s listed by us but isn’t yet on the MLS. This type of listing is sometimes referred to as a ‘pocket listing.’ This is a great opportunity for you to save money while buying a house that’s perfectly suited to your needs without any competition.You can also earn a $1,000 closing credit if you buy one of our listings that’s actively listed on the MLS and a $500 closing credit if you buy any listing through us that’s not one of our listings but is still listed on the MLS.“This program offers many great incentives.”As always, all of our buyers get their new houses re-keyed, because we’d never want you to move into a house without knowing who else has access to it.In addition to these things, our VIP buyers also get to choose from one of four services:  Free carpet cleaning.  Four hours of moving help, which can be delegated and arranged according to your preferences.  Four hours of housekeeping, from either the house you’re moving from or the house you’re moving to.  Four hours of organizing help in your new home.If you’re interested in this program, feel free to reach out to me so we can fill you in on all the details. Our goal this year is to help 100 families, and we’d love for you to be one of them!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of folks have been calling me lately and asking me what’s in store for 2017, so today I’d like to share some of my market predictions for the new year.First off, Realtor.com just classified the Sacramento area as the fourth-hottest region in the nation for 2017. They’re citing the fact that saturation of home prices in the Bay Area is driving investors away from there and into our neck of the woods. Other factors for this buyer influx include the high price of rentals and past foreclosures being wiped off of many people’s credit histories.Even though interest rates are high right now, they’re still very low in a historical context. Right now, they’re hovering just above 4%, but they’re expected to increase as high as 5%. Appreciation is expected to be in the 5% to 8% range, but that will depend on where you’re located and what price point you’re in.“Our area should experience an influx of buyers.”First-time home buyers are still having a tough time finding affordable housing, so any inventory below $350,000 should move pretty quickly. That price point will move up as high and fast as the market will bear. We also see that the luxury, high-end inventory above $800,000 has a lot of traction and should attract a lot of activity.I’m looking forward to helping you move your life forward this year, whether you’re thinking about buying, selling, or investing. We’d love to consult with you and work out a plan that works best for you, so please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. Talk to you again next time!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Our team is hiring, and we’d love for the right person to join us.Why work for us? Let me tell you a little bit about what we do and what we can provide for you. We like to divide our business into three categories: before, during, and after.Our “before” category is the time in which we generate leads and contacts before we get into contract, whether it’s a buyer or seller agreement. We do our lead generation through Google pay-per-click, Facebook, Zillow, Trulia, mail-out campaigns, and postcarding. On our team, you would no longer have to create these items—we’d create them for you.The “during” category is the time in which we’re in contract with a client. We have a management process for this, as well. We would provide a transaction coordinator for you, along with all the information you want or need for educating your clients.Finally, the “after” category is the period after escrow closes where we provide all the information and gifts for your buyers or sellers so you can stay in communication with them. We will also supply the CRM contact management system. With RE/MAX, you’d not only get the four webistes that they provide, but you’d also have access to our two lead generation sites: www.greaterrosevillehomes.com and www.besthomesandestates.com. You would have access to these sites and be able to send them out to your clients and contacts.Our mission is to build great relationships with the people that you already know or the people that you want to get in contact with.“If you’re just looking for transactions, you wouldn’t be a good fit.”What’s the rub? I’m going to be completely honest with you—I don’t want every agent or salesperson to call me. I’m not looking for a salesperson. I’m looking for a consultant. I want someone who’s more interested in helping people and bringing value to those they become associated with. That’s what we built our business on, and that’s the path we want to continue to follow.We’re looking forward to doing more than 200 deals next year and growing our team to be able to help 200 different families. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, we’d love to talk. To contact us, you can either click on the ‘contact’ button, reply to this email, or just give us a call. I look forward to talking with you soon!",

        "title": "How Can You Prepare Your House for Fall and Winter? ",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Now that we’re in the middle of fall and approaching the beginning of winter, what can you as a homeowner do to prepare your house for these seasons?Your first order of business should be to check your smoke detector batteries. Many new homes are either electrically-wired or have smoke detectors with the new 10-year batteries, but there are still plenty out there that only work with 9-volt batteries. I generally advise people to check them at the time changes, which is twice a year.I also recommend checking and replacing your furnace filters at that same interval. This will help your furnace to be much more efficient by getting rid of the dust and animal dander that accumulates inside it. Now’s even a good time to turn your furnace on to exhaust that burnt dust smell that lingers around it after long periods of inactivity. This is especially important if you own a rental property, as this will save you from any inconvenient maintenance calls down the road.“Don’t put off your maintenance chores any longer.”We’ve all been through a power outage or two this time of year, so it’s a good time to locate your flashlights and put them in a place where everyone in the house will know where to find them. It also wouldn’t hurt to keep a couple candles in strategic locations. Make sure they’re safe candles and not the kind that can be easily knocked over.Any and all maintenance items you planned on doing over the summer, whether it’s unblocking some drainage or sealing something that was allowing some moisture intrusion, should be done so that any accumulated moisture doesn’t do serious damage to your foundation. Here in Northern California, we’re pretty spoiled by having a dry summer, but it never hurts to be prepared.If you have any other questions or have a topic in mind you’d like to see me discuss, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to talking with you soon!",

This means when I’m listing a home like yours, it will get a lot more exposure. We actually have five different websites we can market through RE/MAX:  thesilvateam.com  www.remaxgold.com  global.remax.com  www.theremaxcollection.com  home.remaxcommercial.com“Listing with RE/MAX means your home will get more exposure.”There are more than 104,000 agents who work with RE/MAX in 6,986 offices in 95 different countries.

Right away, I get pretty upset, and I let the agent know that the repair was visible and should have been in the offer that their buyer made. We don’t like to receive a bunch of requests after we’re already in escrow.Health and life safety are the main issues we’re concerned with. It’s important that a seller passes a healthy and safe house onto the buyer.“”When we get that request for repairs, we’ll address it with you, the seller, and only address the issues that pertain to health and safety. If there is an electrical issue or mold or termites that were brought out by the home inspection, we’ll address those too. We’ll also find the most inexpensive contractors to take care of these issues, because your money is very important to you and us.I’d love to go over requests for repair in more detail with you, if you’re curious. Give us a call or reach us through the “Contact Us” box and we’ll get right back to you.

It looks like it was taken with an iPhone and doesn’t even utilize the full 25 pictures allowed by the MLS. The most important thing with bad photos is the location and arrangement not making sense to a buyer. You’ve probably seen it in a listing and found yourself wondering where this or that bedroom is, why you only see pictures of one bathroom, and so on.“”We hire a professional photographer here in Roseville for our listings, and he generally gives me about 35 to 40 pictures to choose from. We do a walkthrough video tour as well so potential buyers can see exactly how the house flows and how each room relates to each other. For unique properties requiring aerial views, we actually use a drone. We recently had a unique property with a canyon behind the house and very dramatic views that we wouldn’t have been able to capture without the drone. We had another that was just off the ocean, and we were able to show how close the home was to the ocean with a drone fly-in.The more unique your property is, the more special the photography needs to be, and that’s a free service we offer. If you’d like to see some examples of our professional photography, or you have any questions about how we utilize photography, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "I recently had a client ask me if installing solar panels on his home would affect the sale. With solar, you have an option to lease the system or buy the system. There are advantages to each.Leasing can be up to a 20-30 year term, and sometimes the units are not large enough so you will have to pay a little extra to your utility company at the end of the year. Another thing with leasing is that your technology won’t be updated unless it says so in the lease.If you purchase the system, you can buy the correct size for your home, and you can update your technology, and you can also install a system large enough that you will not have to pay any utilities. Another benefit of purchasing is that you get quite a few tax benefits.“Buying a solar panel gives you great tax benefits.”Just so you know - we sold a few homes for clients last year that were leasing solar, and they have all decided not to continue doing so in their next homes. Just thought you might want to know that!If you have any questions about buying or leasing solar energy, please don’t hesitate to contact me. In some instances, it can raise the value of your home significantly.Thanks for tuning in!",

        "content": "In a seller’s market like the one we’re seeing in Roseville, multiple offer situations have become the norm. If you’re thinking of buying soon, don’t fret! We have got some great tips to share with you that will help you compete and win a bidding war.  A fully-underwritten desktop approval. Most agents just recommend a pre-approval, but we like to take it one step further. This will shorten the amount of time we need to close escrow, and will give you a better shot at competing with cash buyers. Generally, cash purchases come in and it’s a very short close, so this gives you a fighting chance to appeal to the seller in that way as well.“It’s not always about the best price.”  Negotiate before the offer is written. Before we even write an offer, we like to call the listing agent to see what is important to their sellers. It’s not always about the best price, sometimes the seller needs to be able to rent the home back for a period of time, or they want more earnest money. Whatever the case may be, we want to find out what will make your offer stand out above the others.In addition to these, we have plenty more strategies that we use in these types of situations. Things like guaranteeing to beat the highest offer or guaranteeing the appraisal. We would love to go deeper into these tactics with you, just give us a call or send us an email and we’d be glad to help!",

        "content": "What’s happening in the Roseville real estate market? Here’s a quick market update to fill you in.      Is this a buyer’s or seller’s market? We are in a seller’s market. There are a lot more buyers out there than there are sellers, so there aren’t many homes on the market.        What does the current housing inventory look like? Right now, we have about half the inventory that we normally would this time of year. A lot of people are being cautious with the economy. Also, since the sellers don’t have much inventory to pick their new homes from, they are hanging onto their current properties longer.    How does the inventory level affect home values? Despite the low inventory, buyers are being a little finicky, so home values won’t go much higher. Buyers know that their dollars will go a long way.“Interest rates are still below 4%!”      What do the interest rates look like? Interest rates are still below 4% if you have good credit and a healthy debt-to-income-ratio.    What does all this mean for you? Overall, it’s a great time to buy or sell. Most of the better homes are coming on the market now. There aren’t many foreclosures or short sales anymore - all of those are out of the market.If you have any questions about today’s video, give me a call or send me an email.

			<p>I am very fortunate to have lived a life that has given me so much experience and opportunity. Starting out my work life after schooling in construction and working my way through residential construction and then into commercial ‘High Rise” construction.

The Dave Silva Realty Team was built on the premise of providing clients with unrivaled attention to transaction detail. The Team is always willing to find a solution to any problem that may come up during escrow, and they have not had a escrow not complete.</p>
