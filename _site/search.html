        "content": "How are property taxes calculated? Why does one house in one neighborhood have such a high property tax and another house in an adjacent neighborhood have such a low one?Here are a few guidelines to help you understand.First, the good news—one of the amazing things about living in Oregon is our property taxes don’t go up over time after we buy a home. For example, if you buy a home for $200,000 and over time it adds up in value and you sell it later on for $600,000, a tax assessor can’t just assess that property at $600,000. According to our tax code, a property’s assessed value can only go up approximately 3% every year, even if the property is sold over and over again. “Here in Oregon, a property’s assessed value can only go up approximately 3% every year.”There are other reasons your property tax can go up, though. If you do a permitted remodel, your home’s assessed value can go up. Every once in awhile (maybe 10 or 15 years), a particular area will also get reassessed out of necessity. In general, though, if you sell your home for quite a bit more than what it was assessed for, that won’t necessarily flag the assessor. Keep in mind, I’m not a tax assessor, so if want the most accurate answer possible to this question, you should visit your county’s tax assessment office. They can not only answer your questions, but they can also show you how you can protest your property’s assessed value. We’d be happy to pull comparables to help you with this process.Also, remember that every neighborhood has different property tax rates, so they can be all over the map. If you’d like more resources on this topic or you have any other real estate questions or needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we’re going to talk about escrow. It’s a big part of our lingo as real estate agents and escrow is an important part of any real estate transaction, but we rarely define it for our clients.The best way to describe escrow is by using this example from the past. Back when eBay first came out around the turn of the century, I would bid on something and win, but the following back and forth with the seller was tough. I wanted to buy the item and the seller wanted to sell to me, but there needed to be some sort of trust involved. I didn’t want to send my money until I got the item, and the seller didn’t want to send the item until they got their money.“Escrow is an essential part of a successful transaction.”Finally, Elon Musk came up with Paypal to act as a middleman in these transactions. That’s pretty much the same function of escrow in real estate. It’s a neutral third party that holds the deed and the funds in an account until the appropriate time. Once escrow is completed, the seller signs over the deed, the buyer signs over the money, and the transaction is recorded by this third party.Of course, there are plenty of other details about escrow to get into. If you have any questions or want to learn more, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What do you need to do to make your home show beautifully?I know the truth of the matter—we all live differently than when our home is on the market and we’re trying to sell it. When I was selling my home, I even vacated it so I could stage it properly.Here are a few tips that will make your home shine when it’s time to sell it.1. Light your home up. Turn up all the lights and open all the blinds and curtains. We live in Portland where it can get a little gray sometimes, so no matter what, make your home as bright as possible. A good agent should turn on lights while they’re showing a home, but you never know for sure, so take care of that task for them.2. Clear the counters. In the bathroom, you may have hairspray bottles that need to be cleared. In the kitchen, you might have a coffee maker and a toaster oven that need to be removed. In any case, clear your counters so they look big and expansive and remove all personal items sitting on them.3. Clean the house. You can never have your house be too clean. You want it to look like a model home.“No matter what, make your home as bright as possible.”4. Create an inviting scent. It doesn’t hurt to bake some cookies or do whatever you need to do to make the home smell good. You want people to stay longer than they normally would, and creating an inviting scent can do the trick. Avoid odors that are overly pungent or overwhelming, though. This means no fish dinners the night before.5. Set the thermostat to a pleasing temperature. I once had a client who was out of town for a showing and set their home’s thermostat at an arctic freeze. As soon as we walked into that home with the potential buyer, we walked right back out. It was that uncomfortable. You don’t want your home to have that kind of effect. You want people to want to stay inside it.6. Depersonalize the home. If you have a lot of trinkets, pictures, or other personal items cluttering the interior, people won’t remember the home itself. Remove these kinds of things and hide them. That includes anything for your pets as well.If you have any more questions about making your home shine during a showing or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.",

If they’re an individual agent, how will they cover all the tasks?Selling homes is a complex job. This is one instance where numbers really do matter.The following example is one way I like to explain what I mean by this.Imagine that you needed to get your appendix out. Who would you trust? Would you trust a surgeon who successfully performed 150 appendectomies a year? Or, would you trust a surgeon who only did one or two per year?“The only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.”The answer is obvious, and this is the same way you should approach your real estate needs. Someone like myself who sells 150 homes per year and other agents who sell far less may have close to the same commission rate. So, the only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.An agent should be able to show you their experience and results.

        "content": "Today’s topic is one that is near and dear to my heart: inspections. This subject is loaded with expectations. For right now, I’d like to cover it from the buyer’s perspective.When buyers move forward with purchasing a home, it’s very exciting. Then the inspection comes and the buyer is given a 53-page report detailing everything wrong with the property.One thing to keep in mind is that inspections have a two-fold purpose. The first objective is to find anything that needs to be repaired in the property. The second objective is to understand the condition of the house and how to operate systems and appliances within it.The inspector not only finds things that are wrong, they also educate the buyer on the home. After the inspection, the honeymoon period of home buying is pretty much over. When buyers get the inspection report, their rose-colored glasses usually come off and they start to feel nervous about their decision.“With the right person by your side, inspections don’t need to be scary.”Once buyers know what’s wrong, they may start thinking about what they can realistically expect the seller to take care of. The level to which a seller might comply with these expectations can really vary.If a home has been sitting on the market for a while, a seller might be more willing to take care of more items. Ultimately, it’s all about negotiation. Buyers and their agents can ask for repairs, but should know that the seller doesn’t have to agree.If the seller doesn’t agree to fix something, the buyer may terminate the contract and receive a refund. The important thing is to know that you can’t force the seller’s hand. They may have a backup offer in their pocket. It’s important to weigh your options before pulling out of a deal.The inspection could scare you, but the right agent is going to be able to tell you what is normal and what isn’t. Agents like myself will also be able to provide you with access to a large network of quality vendors who can help. With the right person by your side, inspections don’t need to be scary.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

When I sit down with clients, I like to ask them what their “must-haves” and “would-be-nices” are. Must-haves are non-negotiable items, like the number of bedrooms or bathrooms they want in a home.Would-be-nices are items like hardwood flooring, or other negotiable features.This is where the four L’s I mentioned earlier come in. The four L’s of a home are features of a home that can’t be changed, which are:1. Lot. This constitutes the yard or parcel of the house.2. Location. This particular point is a very important aspect of real estate.“Focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in finding your dream home.”3. Layout. This refers to the floor plan. You can technically change this, but doing so is very expensive. If you’re spending a ton of money changing a home’s layout, you may as well just buy a different home.4. Light. I’m not talking about chandeliers or other fixtures, I’m referring to the natural light that is let into the home. For example, a home on a wooded lot is going to tend to be very dark.Other features like granite countertops, hardwood flooring, or a particular style of cabinets are much more easily changed than these four L’s.While I will certainly take all of your specifications in mind when looking for your dream home, focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in choosing the right house.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Many buyers call me feeling excited to get out there and start looking at homes. However, I do recommend that you talk to a lender first, because it’s important to get pre-approved before you begin your home search.There are a couple of reasons why.First of all, getting pre-approved lets you know what your price range is.There’s nothing worse than looking at homes in a higher price range and finding out that you can’t afford them.It’s like test-driving a Lexus only to be told that your budget will only allow you to buy a Camry. Nothing against the Camry, but it can be difficult to get excited about buying one after you’ve seen what the Lexus can do.Similarly, it’s hard to look at homes in a higher price range and then adjust your expectations for the price range you can afford. You will be disappointed with the homes in your price range after you’ve seen other ones.“Getting pre-approved lets you know what price range you should look in.”On the other hand, you may get pre-approved for a higher-priced home and decide that you would prefer not to spend that much. In other words, you may be able to afford a Lexus but decide to stick with a Camry instead.No matter what, it’s really important to know your numbers, and the pre-approval will tell you exactly what to expect.Secondly, getting pre-approved before you start looking at homes makes you more competitive as a buyer. You might find the home you want only to discover that there is an offer deadline. You may also end up competing against multiple offers or cash buyers. The pre-approval letter helps you compete with those buyers. It shows the seller that you have talked to a lender who has verified your income, credit, and assets.If you do find the house of your dreams, a pre-approval letter allows you to make an offer in a timely fashion.So, before you start looking at homes, make sure that you talk to a great lender and get pre-approved.If you have any other questions about getting pre-approved or would like me to put you in touch with one of my trusted lender partners, give me a call or send me an email.

We compare things like the square footage and home additions/improvements to get the right price.“Overpriced homes don’t sell.”If you overprice a home in this market, the listing will simply sit there because people will see better value in other homes that aren’t priced as high. After a while, the home will sit on the market because buyers will start to get a sense that there’s something wrong with it. Even if you reduce the price, the days on market will be a red flag for buyers.On the other hand, it’s virtually impossible to underprice a home in our market. If you underprice a home, the market will determine that it’s an amazing deal.

Each type of house has its pros and cons.With new construction homes, you get a brand-new shiny penny, so to speak. Not only is this option low maintenance because everything is new (new roof, new furnace, etc), but your house’s design features will follow the latest trends in real estate. One of the disadvantages of new construction, though, is you’ll typically have to buy a much smaller lot than what a resale home offers.“Each option has its pros and cons.”With resale homes, your home will have older features, mechanicals, and systems. This doesn’t mean these things can’t be updated, though, so you have to be prepared to budget for updating them. You also have to be prepared to budget for the features that make up your home’s overall fashion aesthetic, such as the floors, cabinets, counters, etc.Again, what’s best for you depends on what your wants and needs are.

For those of you who aren’t aware, staging is the use of furniture by designers to fit the home and highlight the versatility of the floor plan. It makes the home look particularly desirable.The first staging success story I’d like to share involves a seller who had their home listed with another agent for $799,000. It had some wonderful features and yet it didn’t sell. The seller canceled the listing with the other agent and came to me. They didn’t want to drop the price, so we decided to stage the vacant home and keep the price the same.We staged it, and in four days, it sold. Staging worked!“Staging works!”The second story is about a listing that was in an area with a wonderful school district and was just a beautiful house. It started at $575,000 with a different agent, went through a series of price reductions until it was at $549,000, and it still didn’t sell.When the seller came to me, I looked at the home and decided that it needed to be staged. It was a huge vacant home that had a versatile floor plan and just needed to be staged. After staging it, we set the price for $559,000 and three days later, we sold the house for $580,000— $5,000 more than their original asking price.The third example is happening currently. It’s a great condo in a hot area, and it hasn’t been selling. So we took the time to stage the home and relisted it, and we’ve already had five offers on the property.

Investors are quite competitive and are usually cash buyers, but the No. 1 thing that I see that trips up investors the most is that they’re looking at the property like they’re going to live in it. This is especially true for new investors who have made profits elsewhere and have cash to spend or investors coming in from other U.S. markets or overseas.“Treat this as a business and not as an emotional decision.”To look at a property like an investment, you have to really look at the numbers. Will you see a good return on investment and cash flow? What do the numbers say? If you’re going to come out in the black, then it makes sense to proceed. If you aren’t, then you just need to pass on the property.If you’re not looking at the numbers and you’re just looking at the views out the windows or the way the building looks, then you’re not going to fare well.

Although it’s expensive to buy as well, interest rates are still at historic lows, so if you can get a down payment together, you’ll still be buying at an extremely low rate. You’ll also have an equity position. When you think about it, if you’re going to pay a mortgage, you might as well pay yours—not your landlord’s.“If you’re going to pay a mortgage, you might as well pay yours—not your landlord’s.”There are many other statistics that justify buying a home instead of renting. The historical average of home appreciation is 4%, so if you stay in your home for a period of—say—10 years, you’ll add considerable value to it. Even if no appreciation happens after 10 years and you haven’t added any value, you were still able to live rent-free for 10 years.Homeownership comes with certain tax benefits as well. For example, you can write off all of that mortgage interest that you’ve paid every year for 10 years. Be sure to talk to a financial professional as well as a CPA for more information on these kinds of benefits.Obviously, I’m biased when it comes to this decision, but it behooves you to look at what our market has done over the last 10 years in terms of appreciation when deciding whether to buy or rent. Buying certainly beats taking $800, $1000, or even $1,200 every month and lighting a match to it.If you have any questions or are interested in making the leap to homeownership, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.",

I want to sell my home this summer; can I be on the market in a couple of weeks or should I wait until the end of next month?” In short, when is the best time to sell your home? In a market with low inventory like ours, the best time to sell is actually right now. Technically, the best time to sell your home was yesterday.In a low inventory market, you don’t have as much competition. In fact, your neighbor can put their house on the market, price their house wrong, and kind of mess things up for your sale if you wait too long.There is no reason to wait at all if you are ready to go. “There is absolutely no reason to wait to sell your home.”If you want to get your house on the market as quickly as possible, you are not alone. Everyone wants to get their home on the market, so we may see an influx of other properties coming on the market as time goes on. Low inventory situations like ours can change very quickly. So, the best time to sell in a low inventory market is right now. Don’t wait. If you have any questions about getting your house on the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

What is “months of inventory” and what does it mean for our market?If there were no new listings put on the MLS, the months of inventory is the amount of time it would take to sell everything currently on the market. As we expected, the months of inventory for March 2017 was very low at only 1.3 months. That’s the second lowest inventory has been in the last three years. So what does that mean for you?“Both buyers and sellers should hire a pro before entering the market.”It’s a seller’s market, which means if you are thinking about selling, now is the time. However, that doesn’t mean you can just stick a “for sale” sign in your yard and expect a super successful sale. You’ll need to contact a professional real estate agent to help you position your property to get multiple offers and sell for top dollar.If you’re a buyer in this market, you might be getting frustrated. Multiple offers are commonplace in our market and you’ll need a professional to help guide you through getting your offer accepted and beating out the fierce competition.If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you’re selling your house and buying a new one, you’ll probably be faced with the challenge of juggling the two acts at once. Many people need to sell their current home to be able to buy the next one, especially if you’re moving up into a bigger home. Sometimes, these homeowners are fortunate enough to be pre-approved to buy a new home without selling their current home.No matter your situation, though, we need to sit down and come up with a strategy. Just because you’re pre-approved to buy a home without selling your current house doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right way to go. Both options have their pros and cons.By buying your next home first, you maximize your convenience by moving in, getting settled, and then prepping your existing home for sale without having to worry about living in the home you’re trying to sell. You won’t have to constantly make your beds, do all the dishes, and live through home showings. That’s what I call the maximum convenience option.“Buying your next home before selling the old one provides maximum convenience.”By selling your current house first, you have the advantage of knowing exactly how much money you net. Then, once you have cash in hand, you can go shopping for your next home. In this situation, you maximize your dollar because you don’t have any uncertainty about how long you’ll have double mortgage payments and you know exactly where your financials will be.While you might know your financial picture, since we’re in a market with low inventory, you might be sort of a slave to the market. If your dream house isn’t on the market, you might have to resort to renting in the interim or settling for a home that’s on the market.Both strategies have pros and cons, but the best way to figure out what’s best for you and your situation is to talk to your real estate agent. We’ll sit down and talk it through and examine how sellable your property is, as well as where you’re going. We’ll also look at things from a risk management point of view.If you have any questions about buying and selling a home here in the Portland area, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Are smart homes making us stupid?I was recently at an event called Hacker Connect Inman where a prevalent topic of discussion was smart technology and the privacy implications that come with products like Amazon’s Echo being able to listen to the conversations we have inside our homes. There was even mention of a murder trial where one side was trying to subpoena Alexa because she overheard a key conversation and could reasonably have incriminating data stored in her database.This experience got me thinking. I’m a technology junkie and I love innovation. Whenever I look at my phone I’m reminded of all the things it controls in my home and the things I want it to control. You can control pretty much everything these days. You can even have your smart fridge manage your diet by monitoring when you open the door.“Homes are getting smarter, but at what cost?”With that it mind, I came across this article in The Huffington Post that argues that smart homes really are making us stupid.What do I think? In my opinion, innovation is amazing, but only if we use it to solve a problem that we really needed to solve. If it’s used to make a cool thing to solve something that didn’t need to be solved, then that’s not really innovation.I highly recommend you read this article. Do you agree with the author?

Anyone braving the cold to look at properties really needs a home, and they’re ready to write an offer. What’s more, you won’t have to deal with any looky-loos or tire-kickers that might waste your time.        Homes look better in the winter. What looks better than a home decorated for the holidays? These same serious buyers are only going to see your home in its best possible light.  “Winter buyers are ready to write you an offer.”  You’ll face less competition from other sellers.

        "content": "I recently saw on article on Realty Times featuring tips to keep your home safe during the holidays. Many of us travel during the holiday season, and there is nothing worse than coming back to discover that you have been robbed while you were away.Although you can read the full article here, I want to highlight a few of my favorite tips to prevent this nightmare from happening to you.First of all, consider installing a WiFi doorbell or camera. A company called SkyBell makes a doorbell that records video of any visitors that come to your front door. Many of our local cable companies also offer apps that connect to a camera so that you can monitor activity in your house even if you are not there.You should also be smart with your use of lighting. You can use motion-activated lights outside your home or you can get lights that turn on when the sun goes down. Lights with timers are also effective. These lights make it look like someone is home and you don’t have to waste electricity by leaving lights on 24/7.“Let your neighbors or local sheriff department know that you will be away.”Let your neighbors know that you will be gone. Tell them that you will be out of town, give them your cell phone number, and tell them to call you (and the police!) if anything goes wrong. I have gone a step further and reached out to the local sheriff’s department. They are very happy to drive by and monitor your home; after all, the police don’t want your home to get robbed, either.Make sure you stop deliveries. Cancel your newspaper and your mail. All you have to do is hop online and select a vacation start date and end date. When mail or newspapers pile up, thieves take notice and your home becomes a target.Finally, make sure that all of the doors and windows are closed and locked. Did you know that 30% of break-ins are not forced entry? This means that someone got in through an open door or window. Triple-check everything before you leave and make sure that there is no way to get into your house.Following these tips will help prevent break-ins and allow you to relax during your holiday vacation.

        "category": "",
        "content": "When you’re selling a home, it needs to look visually appealing to entice buyers to make an offer, even in a market like this where homes are selling quickly and for top dollar. Here are four ways you can create a great first impression with Portland buyers:      Make the exterior of the home enticing. The walk up to your house should be inviting, not forbidding. Stay on top of lawn mowing, driveway maintenance, and keep your landscaping clean and up-to-date. Clean the windows and make sure address numbers are easy to see. You could even add a colorful welcome mat or door wreath to put it over the top.        Shape up the home’s interior. Once the exterior wows the buyer, you’ve got to continue to impress them on the inside. Keep your kitchen and bathroom counters clear, and organize your closets and shelves. Once you’ve cleared things out, remove personalized photos or knickknacks that make the home feel like your home. We want buyers to visualize their family living in your home, not your family. Clean the home from top to bottom, washing away smudges from the walls and touching up paint where it’s needed.  “In a market like ours, you can’t just bank on multiple offers.”      Check the outside of the home’s evening appearance. Even if you’re positive that it looks great during the day, double check to make sure it looks good at night as well. Replace any missing lightbulbs or non-functional outdoor lighting.        Make the necessary repairs. You’re going to have to make them one way or another, so you might as well do them up front, if not after the inspection. Anything that is a simple, physical fix should be taken care of. Stained carpet or holes in walls should be replaced so the home looks clean, simple, attractive, and problem-free to the buyer.  In a market like ours, you can’t just bank on multiple offers. Those that do are shocked that buyers expect a perfect home. We don’t want you to be shocked, we want you to be able to get top dollar. Following these tips is the best way to do that.If you have any questions for us, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",
