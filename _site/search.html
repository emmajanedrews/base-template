        "content": "When selling your home, there are five costly mistakes you should try to avoid:“Buyers want to be able to picture themselves living in your home.”  Mispricing your home: This is common because everybody thinks their house is more valuable than their neighbor’s. If you price too low, you can leave money on the table and if you price too high, you won’t get any offers. Then, as buyers look at other homes, they’ll start thinking there’s something wrong with yours. Price is the most critical point in presenting your home.  Not doing necessary repairs before listing: Most people just want to move on without investing in their home, but if you want to get the most value, it’s better to do these repairs first. Buyers don’t want to have to buy a house and then put in the sweat equity themselves; they don’t see the future value.  Not presenting the home correctly: This means not staging it or not depersonalizing your home. Think of the buyer–they want to imagine living there, not see all your clutter. Make your home open so buyers can see themselves living there.  Not having professional photos: This is a critical aspect of presenting your home because 90% to 95% of people now start their home search on the Internet by looking at photos. If you don’t have professional photos, your house will not stand out. Hiring a professional will pay itself off in the long run.  Not hiring a real estate professional: Hiring a professional can be expensive, yes, but they will take care of all the little things I’ve mentioned like getting professional photos and marketing your home. They’ll also have a team behind them to help you through this stressful process.If you have any questions about the home selling process or you’re thinking of putting your home on the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to answer any questions you have.",

        "content": "We are delighted to be joined today by Angie McCoy of Evergreen Staging and Design, who is going to be talking with us about the top five home design trends in real estate for 2017. Without further ado, let’s take it away.1. New paint colors. Paint is a wonderful way to update your home because it’s inexpensive and creates an upbeat look. Sherwin Williams has come out with their color of the year for 2017, Poised Taupe. It’s a mix of gray and brown that fits perfectly in any room. The color experts, Pantone, also picked several colors that they think are going to be big this year, including purple and grape shades that people love.2. Rich materials. These include things like reclaimed wood on fireplaces and metal mixes of silvers, golds, pewters, and bronzes. It also includes furry textures on throw rugs and pillows.“Great kitchens are selling homes in this market.”3. Going green. Basically, make the home more energy efficient. People want to feel like they are helping the environment and they can do that in many ways like updating windows, adding solar panels, and getting tankless water heaters.4. A functional home office. More and more people are working from home these days, and they want a designated space to do that. Turning a third bedroom into a home office is a good way to find that space.5. Splurging on kitchen renovations. Kitchens are almost single-handedly selling homes in this market. The kitchen is the heart of the home, where most people begin and end their day. Small updates like changing the backsplash or upgrading appliances are great ways to add value and increase the functionality of your kitchen.If you want to improve the look and feel of your interior, give Angie a call at (214)-984-4233 or send her an email at info@evergreenstaging.com.If you have any other real estate questions, we are always here to answer them. Just reach out. We look forward to hearing from you soon!",

        "content": "If you’ve been paying attention to the real estate market lately, none of this should be a surprise to you. However, if you haven’t, here are the biggest changes I’ve been seeing in the Frisco market this year as compared to last year. Inventory increased by almost 8% in March to about 8,300 homes. However, we continue to have a lower supply of homes on the market that we have seen in the past seven years.Demand has stayed strong, with about 40,000 people moving to the area each month. With new companies moving to the area, excellent public schools, and no state taxes, north Texas remains one of the most sought-after areas in the nation for homebuyers. With a high level of demand and a low level of supply, home prices are going to continue to rise. In fact, right now, we are seeing the highest average sale price in our history. It’s up 12% to an astonishing $377,000.“North Texas remains one of the most sought-after areas in the nation”What does this mean for buyers? With limited options, you need a good real estate professional on your side who can find the home for you and find it quickly. I’m talking as soon as it comes on the market. You must also expect to pay at least list price, if not more, to get the home you want in this competitive market.For sellers, it’s all about preparation. Your home is going to sell quickly if you have an agent who can help you prepare your home, price it correctly, and present it to buyers in its best light. You also need to make sure you have your home purchase plans in place before you even put your home on the market. If you price correctly with a professional who knows what they’re doing, chances are that you will have a lot of showings and a lot of competing bids for your home. If you have any other questions about the current state of the market or you want to take advantage of the current conditions as a buyer or seller, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "If you are thinking of listing your home during the selling season, then you need to find out what your home is worth. There are four ways to do just that:1. Find out what your X factors are. Knowing which homes have sold in your neighborhood is a great starting point, but you must also figure in which features your home has that could increase its value.2. Remember the three C’s of pricing: consumption, condition, and competition. Consumption is the number of homes sold in your particular neighborhood. You also need to compare the condition of your home to other homes on the market; evaluate your home as if you were a picky buyer. Finally, it’s important to know who your competition is. How many homes in your area are on the market? How many of those homes are in your price range?3. Hire an appraiser. Now, appraisals can cost $400 to $500 but if you get varied results from different agents, then it may be a good idea to bring in an appraiser to give you a better range.“Hire a professional real estate agent and ask for a CMA.”4. Hire a real estate professional and ask for a comparative market analysis, or CMA, to get a more accurate value of your home.
