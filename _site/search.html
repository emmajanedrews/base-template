The tip I’d like to share this time is: Just do it!There are so many things in life that we tend to put off for another day instead of taking care of them as soon as possible. I’m not going to lie to you. Putting your home on the market certainly isn’t the most fun experience. However, it is rewarding.“Even small changes can really add up and pay off.”Let’s take the example of selling a car for $10,000. Most people in this situation will spend $200 on getting the car detailed, having its tires filled or replaced, or getting it waxed. But when these same people sell a $200,000, they hesitate to spend even $500 on these kinds of upgrades and finishing touches.However, little changes can really add up and pay off. Before you bring in a Realtor, start clearing out the clutter and doing everything else you can to prepare your home for the market.Right before you’re ready to list, hire professional cleaners to make your home really shine. The time to start preparing your home for the market is today.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What is homeowners insurance? Why should you consider obtaining it when purchasing a home?Homeowners insurance is something that’s required by the lender. If you get a loan to purchase a house, the lender will require that you insure their asset.When you obtain homeowners insurance, you want to make sure of a couple of things. First, you want to make sure it covers the structure of the house—not just what you pay for it, but what it would cost for you to rebuild it. You also need to make sure it covers the contents of the house. Just because the TV you bought four years ago is now worth $100 doesn’t mean you can replace it for $100, so make sure you get replacements costs.“There’s nothing that will fix a flooded house if you don’t have flood insurance.”Another thing to consider is if you’re buying in an area that requires flood insurance. Flood insurance is required in flood zone AE areas, but it’s not required in zone X areas. If you look at what happened in Houston last year and West Virginia the year before, those areas didn’t require flood insurance—they were flood zone X areas.Living in flood zone X areas doesn’t cost nearly as much as living in flood zone AE areas, but I still recommend getting flood insurance. Remember—insurance is not for the expected. If we woke up one day and knew our car was going to crash, we wouldn’t drive it that day. We have insurance to be insured against the unexpected.There’s nothing that will fix a flooded house if you don’t have flood insurance. Those funds will have to come out of your back pocket, and most people don’t have an extra $100,000 or $200,000 lying around to repair a house that’s been destroyed by a flood.If you have any questions about homeowners insurance or any other unexpected costs when buying a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.",

Tax returns, bank statements, and some bills are essentially all you need to hold onto.Unless it’s something like a birth certificate, wedding certificate, or another important document, you only need to keep most old mail and records for about three years. After that time, it’s usually okay to throw some things away.“Unnecessary paper can really be the Achilles’ heel of a home you’re preparing to sell.”When you do get rid of important papers, though, don’t just toss them. Make sure you shred anything that could have your personal information on it. If you don’t own a shredder, there are many places you can have this done. You can even come down to my office if you need something shredded badly and don’t know where else to go.The bottom line is this: get rid of unnecessary paper when you clean your home. Most of it isn’t important to keep, is a fire hazard, and is just taking up space. Paper causes a lot of clutter. It can really be the Achilles’ heel of a home you’re preparing to sell.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

We can’t do that if you need to move in, say, 30 days, when you called us yesterday and expect it to be listed by tomorrow.Your photos won’t look as good, your house won’t be staged properly, you’ll have items that need to be put into storage, your lawn/landscaping will need to be cleaned up, and so much more.All those things and more besides will have to be done in order to present your house in its best light, which will get you the most return on the dollar.

You’ll get more money for a home that is shown in optimal condition, and it will sell faster as well.

        "content": "The first task I want to talk about when it comes to things you must do when selling your home is sorting, or how to simplify your moving experience.There are a couple ways you can do this. One way is to sort stuff into piles. This includes stuff you want to donate, stuff you want to trash, and stuff you want to keep. I generally suggest another way, though, and that way is something I call the “one-year rule.”The one-year rule goes as follows: If you haven’t used it in the last year and you’re not going to use it in the next year, sell it or get rid of it because it’s cluttering your life. From there, get rid of anything you consider trash. Take it to the dumpster or the landfill. Don’t let your kids or your spouse look at what it is—just get rid of it.Most people who move are moving up, so if that’s the case for you, then your current house is too small. If your house is too small for you and appears to be too small for you, then it will appear to be too small for the next person, too.“Renting a storage unit will go a long way in getting your home sold.”That’s why my second tip is to rent a storage unit and store everything that’s not essential to your day-to-day life inside it. This means removing all your extra clothes from your closets so they look big and roomy, all the storage boxes lying around in the basement or attic, and other stuff like that so there’s plenty of room in the house. Storage units aren’t cheap, but what they can do in terms of getting your home sold is incredible.I don’t advise getting a pod instead of a storage unit. A pod just tells everyone you ran out of room in the house and what’s leftover is sitting in your driveway.If you have any questions about getting your house ready to sell, whether that involves staging, sorting, or throwing things away, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

You need more money down than the other one, and we don’t use that one very often for renovation projects.The FHA 203K loan has two different options, depending on the size of your renovation project. There’s a streamlined loan that is for repairs that are $30,000 or less and a full FHA 203k that is for as much as you need, as long as the house appraises as repaired.“ON A FULL FHA LOAN, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE HOME, AS LONG AS IT APPRAISES.”When you apply for the loan, you need to have two separate contractors come out to the house and write a bid for the repairs that they see that need to be done. These two bids need to match—not on the dollar amount but on what needs to be done to the home. Those bids are then sent to the lender so they can approach for the requested amount.For the streamlined FHA loan, those repairs can only go up to $30,000 and can’t be on anything structural, so no walls can be knocked out or rooms added. On a full FHA loan, you can do whatever you would like to the home—add or take out walls, add a new master bedroom or bathroom—as long as the house appraises with those items included and it’s under the lending limit, which in our area is $271,000.If you have any questions about renovation loans, feel free to give me a call.

The entire room looked like one big ivy vine because every surface was covered with the same print.“YOU NEED TO HAVE CLASSY, FRESH LINENS IN YOUR HOME.”You need to have classy, clean, fresh linens in your home. If you don’t want to get rid of your old, comfortable bedspread, simply put the new one on top of it when you prepare to sell your home. Doing so will position your house to sell faster and for more money.You want people to feel like they could live in your house. They need to be comfortable in your house and every room needs to be fresh and clean.If you have any other questions about staging your home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email.

So how can you make your bedroom look more appealing to potential buyers?If you’re selling, the most important thing to remember about your bedrooms is to have the proper size bed in them. Oftentimes, we go into a house with a regular sized bedroom that has a king bed in it. Frankly, I don’t even know how they got it in there. It may be how you want to live, but you don’t want the buyer to think that the room is too small. That’s what an oversized bed does.“IN MOST HOUSES, A QUEEN BED IS THE LARGEST YOU SHOULD GO.”In most standard houses, a queen bed is usually as large as you should go. If you can’t walk on either side of the bed comfortably, you probably don’t need a king bed in there. If you have a trunk or bench at the end of your bed for storage, make sure that’s an appropriate size as well.If you have any questions for us about staging bedrooms or anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email.

Search All Homes on the MLSWhen it comes to home inspections, one of the most common misconceptions is that they cover only a basic inspection.Home inspections are designed to give you a report card on your house. In the grand scheme of things, it outlines everything a home inspector can find during a three- to four-hour window. They won’t find everything, but they will find more than just the basics.An inspector will look at the systems, appliances, and HVAC, to name a few. Their job is to give you a good report card of your house, because not all these items will be covered by the contract, and not all these things will be repaired by the contract. Instead, you’ll get a good list of things to work on in the house. Remember, when you buy a house, you buy a used house; it’s going to have issues.“THE INSPECTOR’S JOB IS TO GIVE YOU A GOOD REPORT CARD OF YOUR HOUSE.”The good news is that you’ll get a really good report up front to know what’s wrong with it.If you have any questions about home inspections and what you get from them, or you’re ready to buy or sell a home in the Roanoke market, give me a call or send me an email.

A material defect is defined as “something that would’ve caused a normal buyer not to purchase the home had they known it was there.”.“HOME INSPECTIONS ARE THERE TO INVESTIGATE ANY MAJOR ISSUES IN THE HOUSE.”What an inspector looks for during a home inspection is major issues within the house. They’re not looking for any cosmetic issues such as the paint or the wall coverings. If you’re worried about those types of issues, they should be taken care of in the contract.

Absolutely.Let’s say someone wants to sell their $6,000 used car. The first thing they’re going to do is get it detailed, right? It’s perfectly conceivable that they’ll spend as much as $300 for that detail. That’s 5% of the car’s overall value.Unfortunately, people who are trying to sell their house don’t carry this same mindset when it comes to landscaping, even though their house might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. You need to invest in your home to get it sold for top dollar. How do you do that? You do that by giving it instant curb appeal.“YOU NEED TO INVEST IN YOUR HOME TO GET IT SOLD FOR TOP DOLLAR.”Houses generate more offers and sell faster when the curb appeal is there.
