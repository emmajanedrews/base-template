        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Winterizing your home can pay for itself and then some. It can help you save money on costly repairs. The right project could save you money directly in the form of lower utility bills. The right winterization project could significantly increase the resale value of your home.But here’s the thing: Not all winterization projects are equally valuable. That’s why I’ve collected the top three projects that stand out in terms of the return they will give on your investment.1. Fiberglass attic insulation.Each year, Remodeling Magazine releases its Cost vs. Value Report for various home upgrades. This year, only one project had an ROI of over 100%and that was fiberglass attic insulation. If you add insulation to your attic tomorrow and decide to sell your home right after, you can expect that you will be able to sell for a premium. Even if you aren’t selling your home just yet, then the improved attic insulation will accrue even more value in terms of lower heating bills and increased comfort in your home.2. Energy-efficient windows. A typical window replacement yields over a 70% return in terms of the resale value of your home. Depending on the shape of your current windows, you could save an additional 15% or more off your heating bills. Plus, new windows can add even more value to your home in terms of increased thermal and acoustic comfort, more light, and better design.“New, energy-efficient windows bring a nice ROI.”3. Gutters and downspouts. This last item won’t save you money directly by cutting down your energy bills. It could, however, save you tens of thousands of dollars in terms of avoided repairs. Clogged gutters and downspouts can trap moisture. When the weather gets really cold, they can also help ice to form. This can ruin your roof and sidings, causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage. It will also impact the curb appeal of your home, which generates higher returns in terms of resale value than remodeling the inside of your home.And those are three of the best winterization projects you can undertake to maximize your investment. If you have any questions for me about any of these upgrades or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "Homebuyers Are Feeling Optimistic",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here’s a paradox for you: Right now, homebuyer confidence is at an all-time high, according to a survey performed by Fannie Mae. Furthermore, an increasing number of people, particularly renters, think now is a good time to buy a home. Yet at the same time, housing inventory remains very tight. It’s down 6.5% nationally from last year. Home prices are also up 6.9% nationally over last year.In other words, homebuyers are optimistic at a time that the market seems to be favoring sellers. So, what’s going on? Why are homebuyers so optimistic all of a sudden? Here are three possible explanations:1. Lending is loosening up. Over the past several years, mortgage rates have seen historical lows. This has meant that homes are actually more affordable, in spite of the increase in prices. However, lending has been very tight. Fortunately, that’s changing. Lenders are approving mortgages at the highest rate since 2011, with 77% of mortgages for home purchases approved.“Lenders are approving mortgages at the highest rate since 2011.”2. Jobs are looking good. At the moment, fewer homebuyers are worried about losing their jobs, according to the same Fannie Mae survey. It’s not just job security that’s contributing to greater optimism about buying a home. Overall income is higher, making homes more affordable by comparison. The median household currently has 150% of the income needed to buy a median home, compared to a historical average of just 125%.3. Long-time renters are ready to buy. Millennials, the generation of people born after 1980, have largely opted out of homeownership until now. They have been renting for a longer time, putting them higher up on the pay scale compared to previous generations of first-time homebuyers. But now, many millennials are finally hitting an age when they are willing to commit to buying instead of renting. This is reflected in the Fannie Mae report, which states that much of the increase in homebuyer optimism comes from current renters.What all does this mean for you? If you’re looking to buy a home, all of the above reasons should give you confidence that now is indeed the right time to buy.If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, click the links above to search for homes on the MLS or find out how much your home is currently worth.And if you have any questions about the Raleigh real estate market, whether you’re thinking of selling or buying, give me a call. I’m here to help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Investing in real estate is no longer restricted to the super wealthy. According to a recent survey, real estate investors now make up 15% of the population. That translates to almost 50 million individuals who invest in at least one property other than their primary residence.In fact, 89% of U.S. investors are interested in putting their money in real estate because of benefits such as cash flow, tax incentives, leverage, and value appreciation that come with investing in multiple properties.“Home flipping offered a record-breaking 49% return in 2016.”Are you curious about investing in real estate? If so, here are five different ways you can get started:1. Buy and rentThis is probably the most traditional way to invest in real estate. It simply involves buying a property and renting it out. Now is a good time for this kind of investing because rental rates are on the rise (8% since last year) but the downside of this investing approach is the time and effort needed to manage and maintain your investment.2. Buy and sellAlso known as home flipping, this involves buying a property and reselling it soon after for a profit. Home flipping has offered a record-breaking 49% return in 2016.3. Real estate investment groupsReal estate investment groups are organizations that buy a set of properties and then sell them to individual investors.The main benefit of this approach is that you typically do not need to act as the landlord because the investment group handles property management for you (for a fee of course).4. Crowdfunding sitesRecently, there’s been an explosion of sites such as Prosper and Lending Club, which allow individuals to invest in various real estate development projects. Through crowdfunding sites, you can be a part of a large-scale property investment while investing only a moderate amount of money. On the other hand, crowdfunding sites act as a middleman and charge fees which can eat into your profits.5. REITsReal estate investment trusts (REITs) are like mutual funds for real estate.They typically pay high dividends. However, they also do not offer all of the typical benefits of investing in real estate, such as increased leverage and tax benefits.Each of these investing approaches offers a tradeoff between possible profits, risks, and costs.The one constant is that you can minimize your risks with due diligence and by consulting with an experienced real estate professional.If you have any questions for us or you’re interested in investing in real estate yourself, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Buying your first home can be an incredibly exciting time. However, it requires a huge commitment and a sizable investment. That’s why I want to share my three top tips to help first-time homebuyers protect themselves during this crucial period:1. Know what you can affordYour mortgage is only a part of what you will need to pay when you buy a home. Homeownership comes with plenty of other expenses, including closing costs, taxes, property insurance, maintenance costs, and homeowner association fees.Once you have a clear idea of how much all of these items will cost, you can compare it to your current monthly expenses. Then you can figure out the kind of home you can honestly afford without getting carried away and without getting bogged down in debt.2. Choose your lender wiselyChoosing a lender is not something you should base only on the lowest rate. A competent and trustworthy lender will offer you advice on how to improve your credit and also help you take advantage of special homebuyer programs that might benefit you.But how do you find the right lender specifically for you? It’s often best to get recommendations from friends who have already worked with a lender or from a real estate agent you trust.3. Don’t overlook the detailsThere are many details that go into buying a home, and missing any of them can be a costly mistake. I always advise buyers to get a professional inspection done on their home, separate from the appraisal. An inspection will set you back about $300, but it can save you thousands of dollars down the line, and it can even prevent you from making a decision to buy a home that you would later regret.“An inspection will cost about $300, but it can save you thousands.”A second example is understanding the fine print in the various contracts you will be signing. If there’s anything that isn’t clear to you, talk to your real estate agent and have it spelled out.The process of buying a home can be intimidating, and that’s why professional real estate agents are there to help. These three quick tips are only the start of the things you need to watch out for when buying your first home.If you need more advice or you are ready to start looking for a home, get in touch with me. I love working with first-time homebuyers, and I can help you get your perfect new home with minimum hassle.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "There are a lot of myths out there believed by first-time homebuyers that we wanted to quickly debunk for you.1.) MYTH: You need 20% down to buy a home. There are several home loan programs out there that let you buy a home with as little as 3% or even 0% down.2.) MYTH: If you’ve saved up for a down payment, you’re ready to buy a house. In reality, you’ll have closing costs to pay, not to mention things like appraisals and inspections. Talk to both your agent and your lender to find out exactly how much you need to save to buy your perfect home.“Some loan programs allow you to buy a home with a little as zero money down.”3.) MYTH: The lowest interest rate is always the best. That’s not always the case because in certain situations, you might need a little extra money up front. You might be able to use a lender credit for these expenses by taking a slightly higher interest rate. Additionally, the lowest interest rate might not come with the best customer service. In today’s market when it’s crucial to close on time and connect with your lender throughout the week, it’s important to have the best level of service.4.) MYTH: Renting will be cheaper than buying. In the Raleigh market, your rent is likely to go up every year. A mortgage payment, on the other hand, stays the same every year. When you rent, you don’t build any equity, but spend your money paying off your landlord’s mortgage instead of investing in your own equity.5.) MYTH: You need a credit score of more than 700. Many programs allow you to have a score in the low- to mid-600 range and still buy a home. In certain situations, we can even go as low as 580.If you have any questions about buying your first home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you have a pet and you’re looking to sell your home, then read on for some helpful advice.The good news is, many homebuyers are looking for a pet-friendly home.Two out of three of us have a pet, and 61% of pet owners say they have trouble finding a home that is a good match for their pet.In fact, a recent survey estimates that 31% of animal owners frequently don’t put in an offer because a home would not suit their pet.This means that if your home is a good match for a pet, it will be attractive to a large pool of dedicated animal owners.On the other hand, 67% of Realtors also estimate that actually having a pet in your home can make it harder for you to sell.So what can you do? Here are three things I typically recommend:1. Repair any damageFloors, walls, doors, the yard — these are some typical areas that pets love to chew, scratch, and dig up.Repairing this damage is an investment that will pay for itself many times over in terms of a higher selling price.“Pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers are.”2. Get a professional to remove pet odorsMany pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers will be.That’s why you should hire a professional cleaning crew to clean any carpets, rugs, or upholstery that have absorbed pet odors.Once you’re done with the cleaning, ask a friend or your Realtor for a sniff assessment to make sure the job is really complete.3. Take your pet out during showingsSome people are afraid of animals. Others are allergic. And regardless of the time, money, and effort you’ve put in to clean and repair your home, many buyers will be prejudiced by knowing that a pet currently lives there.That’s why I recommend taking your pet out during showings and also removing any pet objects such as toys, food bowls, or scratching posts.By following these three simple guidelines, you will be able to sell your home for top dollar, whether the buyer is a pet owner or not.If you’re curious what you could get for your home in the current market, check out my home value calculator on my site.And in case you have any questions or concerns about preparing your home for a sale, give me a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’m joined again by Brandon Harris from Perennial Mortgage Group to answer an important question: What’s the difference between working with a local mortgage lender and an online mortgage provider?The main difference boils down to human interaction. With so many of our daily tasks already automated, it’s not surprising that some people opt for online mortgage providers. When you’re looking to finance a home purchase, however, you need to work with someone you can communicate regularly with and meet in person.“You’ll never have an online lender give you their cell phone number in case you have questions.”It’s important to remember that obtaining a mortgage is not a single transaction. It can take anywhere from 25 days to up to 60 days or more. For most people, getting a mortgage is something they’ll only do a handful of times in their life. Local lenders do it on a daily basis and are experts in your area. If you have questions and need answers, you need an expert you can turn to.Online lenders in commercials like to tout how easy it is to get a mortgage by suggesting all you have to do is provide all your information and click a button. In reality, that’s not the case. There are many different tasks involved in getting a mortgage, and you’ll eventually have to speak with somebody to get them accomplished. If you use an online mortgage provider, there’s a good chance you’ll be dealing with different people throughout the process or whoever happens to be in the office that day. With a single local lender, they know your situation and what’s going on the whole time.If you have any more questions about the mortgage lending process, you can call Brandon at (919) 353-1918 or email him at brandon@perennialmortgage.com.If you have any other questions or are interested in buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’m joined by Dan Woodard with Corporate Investors Mortgage Group to go over the mortgage approval process.If you’re thinking about buying a home, the first thing you need to do is get pre-approved. By doing so, you’ll run into a lot fewer problems when you purchase the house. For example, you as a buyer would have already provided your bank statements, paystubs, etc. for a lender to review and make sure there are no problems in your finances that might come up after the home goes under contract.Now, there is a difference between getting pre-qualified and pre-approved. A pre-qualification is basically a short conversation between the lender and the borrower in which the borrower provides some information and the lender does some quick calculations. After that, the lender informs the borrower that they are qualified.The pre-approval is the next step. To get pre-approved, you need to provide the documents that proves the information provided by the borrower was accurate. Completing this step is highly recommended for anyone looking to buy a home.Once you’ve found a home and made an offer has been accepted, your loan request will go to an underwriter. Once your loan request reaches this point, it will have gone through all the processing necessary to verify it. Whether it’s a clean underwrite or a difficult underwrite will depend on how thorough the processing was done. The underwriter may ask for some follow-up documents if they see something they have a question about, but then they will clear the loan to close.“When going through the loan approval process, make sure you don’t have credit issues, switch jobs, or leave anything out of your file.”There are a few reasons a loan will fall through. Credit issues, changing jobs during the underwriting process, or missing information in a file are the most common. Make sure you have all of those things taken care of before you start the process.If you have any questions for Dan, you can reach him at (919-676-1111).As always, if you have any questions for me, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "When you’re selling your home, there are certain things you can do to avoid issues with the inspection. Today, I’m joined by Greg Watkins with Advance Look Inspections to help me explain this topic.You obviously want your home to be in tip-top shape when buyers come through. There are some things you can take care of in the home before the inspection even occurs. According to Greg, curb appeal means a lot as a buyer approaches your house, so keep your shrubbery trimmed with 12 inches of clearance from the house. Doing so will also help prevent pests from getting into your home.Additionally, don’t overlook areas of wood rot, which can take place in 95% of the house. Most wood rot, Greg, says, comes from gutters that aren’t clean and cause water intrusion. If you have backed up gutters, it will show up on the home inspection. This issue can cause wood rot all the way down the side of your house, including the siding, the soffit, the trim, and the fascia.“Clogged gutters can cause a lot of costly damage in the long run.”When it comes to the HVAC system, you need to change your filters, and Greg recommends that you monitor it for the first few months after you move into a house to get an idea of how much dust is in your house. Some people have a lot of dogs and don’t realize how much debris can build up, Greg says.Any areas that look dingy should be repainted, and it always helps to clean your windows. You might want to do some serious scrubbing to determine whether your windows are dirty or have a defective seal.As for pre-list inspections, Greg says that he’ll do the same inspection that he would do for a home buyer. It will include the foundation, the siding, the roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC system. As Greg says, it may save you time and money and makes everyone’s life a little bit easier.If you’re in need of a home inspection either as a home buyer or seller, you can reach Greg at 919-523-9241.If you’re interested in buying or selling a home in the Raleigh market, give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Brandon Harris from Perennial Mortgage Group is here to answer a few common questions about credit scores.1. Why are credit scores important to the loan process? Credit scores give the lender a history of your past, including how you pay your bills and how you work with other lenders or credit card companies. Your credit score lets the lender know if you are reliable enough to be approved for a mortgage.2. What is the best credit score you can have? You can have a credit score as high as 900. However, any score over 760 is an excellent credit score. Also, if your credit score is higher than 760, it won’t necessarily impact your interest rate any further; 760 is a great score on its own.3. What kind of credit score do you need in order to obtain a loan? A lot of people think that you need a credit score of 780 or above to get a home. However, you can actually have score in the low 600s and get a home. Typically, your score should be around 640, but Brandon has worked with clients in the 620 range before.4. What are some reasons for a low credit score? Late payments will bring your credit score down, as well as not using your credit card enough. Medical collections can also drag down your credit score; on the bright side, medical collections are fairly easy to remove from your credit report.“Medical collections are fairly easy to remove from your credit report.”5. How can you raise your credit score? First of all, catch up on your payments. Once you have a strong history of making those payments on time, your score will improve. You can also speak with a credit repair agency. Sometimes, if you have a friend or family member with a great credit score, you can become an authorized user on their credit card in order to build good credit for the future.6. How often can you check your credit score? There is no real limit on the number of times you can check your credit. Brandon recommends going to AnnualCreditReport.com once a year to check your score for free. However, if you go to several different banks in a short amount of time to check your credit, you can get a hit on your credit score. Technically, you should still be allowed to shop around if you are looking for a lender. Just don’t look at too many.7. When does a lender check your credit score, anyway? That is always going to be one of the first things that your lender does. After the lender collects all of your information, they will get your credit score so they can put together a pre-qualification letter for you.If you have any other questions about your credit score or the loan process, you can reach Brandon at 919.848.4748 or brandon@perennialmortgage.com.

There have been tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes all over the last few months, so we wanted to give you some tips to make sure you’re approaching things the right way.For starters, use a licensed contractor when repairing any damage or making any renovations. Make sure you verify their license and make sure they are in good standing with the state. Contractors are necessary for things like electrical and plumbing work, and your insurance company may not cover future damage if you don’t use a licensed contractor.If you’re going to expand your square footage at all, you’ll need permits. If you don’t have an addition permitted and inspected, it won’t be added to the square footage on your home when you list it. When seeking out contractors, be sure to check their references and pay them when the work is complete, not upfront.“Use a licensed contractor when making renovations.”Certain jobs, like removing branches and tree limbs from your yard, don’t require contractors. In fact, you may even be able to reach out to the local scouts, YMCAs, and other service organizations that are looking for ways to help clean up.Finally, make sure to keep copies of any receipts to prove that any repairs or renovations you made were legitimate.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The home buying process can be complicated, especially when unexpected issues arise. There are five common mistakes that many home buyers make that can be detrimental to their purchase in the end:1.Not getting pre-approved. Getting pre-approved for financing before making an offer is crucial. In today’s competitive market, it’s better to get pre-approved before you even begin looking at homes so that you know how much home you can afford. First, speak with a local lender. We can put you in touch with some great lenders.2.Not determining their wants vs. their needs. It’s important for buyers to distinguish what they want in a home versus what they actually need. For example, the buyer may want a four-car garage when in reality they only need a two-car garage.3.Not utilizing the due diligence period. The due diligence period can last anywhere from two weeks to a month, and it’s important to use this time period to check on your home before the closing. Test all of your major systems, go through everything with a fine-tooth comb, and schedule all of your inspections during this time.4.Becoming emotionally attached to one specific home. Buyers should be careful not to become too set on one particular home before looking at others. A good agent will ensure that the home that the buyer loves is in good condition and is worth the asking price. A home is often the biggest investment that a person will make in their entire life, so making a decision based on information rather than on personal feelings is critical.5.Not hiring a good agent to assist them. A good agent will keep buyers informed and share all of the information about the home and the neighborhood with them. Because good agents will coordinate almost every piece of the transaction, they can also help buyers get a better price on the home and represent their best interests during the negotiation process.Don’t make these mistakes during your next home search.
