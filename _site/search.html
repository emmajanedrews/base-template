        "content": "Because the weather has been miserable with near-record days of rain, we’ve seen fewer showings than we did earlier in the spring. Hang in there though, because **we’ve still got plenty of buyers and low inventory. **Compared to last April, both sales and units sold were up 8.99% and 6.6%, respectively. The average for days on market dropped from 53 to 51.This April compared to last April, the number of new listings was down. Additionally, closed sales this April shot up 24.7% from the month before. In Loudoun county, the number of units sold fell 1.42%, but the average for days on market improved to 49 days this year from 68 last year. Nationally, home prices are up 6%, and up 2.6% compared to last year.“HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A GREAT INVESTMENT, BOTH FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.”Looking ahead to future projections, waiting until next year could cost you almost $200 more in your mortgage payment. This proves why homeownership is a great investment both financially and emotionally. Harvard University’s Joint Center of Housing Studies recently released a study showing the top reasons why.Financial Reasons:      Financially, housing is typically the one leveraged investment available, because you’re paying for housing, whether you own or rent.        Housing is usually a form of forced saving.        There are tax benefits to owning.        Owning is a hedge against inflation.  **Emotional Reasons: **      Owning a home is a good way to build wealth that can be passed along to your family.        You have an actual structure providing space and safety for your family.        You have control over your space, like renovations or updates.        Owning a home provides a place to raise children and give them a good education.  Although rates are still low, waiting to buy could be costly for your monthly mortgage payment.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We’ve all hear the term “curb appeal,” but does it really help sell your home?Homes that look good from the street - that is, homes with good curb appeal - should help you get a higher price and take less time to sell. To improve your curb appeal, you don’t need to make a bunch of renovations to the exterior of your home. We’re talking about **regular maintenance and some extra beautifying tasks that will go a long way. **The question becomes which projects will give you the best payoff? Here’s a list of what we think is worth your time:      Wash the front of your house. Before you scrape any paint or plant more azaleas, wash the dirt, mildew, and general grunge off the front of your house. This will help show your house in the best light. A power washer is an ideal way to do this, but a bucket of soapy water and a long-handle, soft bristle brush can get the job done as well. Don’t forget to take care of the sidewalks and driveway while you’re at it!  You should also wash your windows inside and out, wipe the cobwebs from the eaves, and wash out your downspouts. Don’t forget to wash off your garage as well.        Freshen the paint job. After power washing or scrubbing the front, the most commonly offered advice I share with clients is to give the exterior of the home a good paint job. Buyers will instantly notice it and appraisers will value it. Painting can be an expensive and time-consuming facelift, but it is usually well-worth the effort.        Address the roof. The condition of your roof is one of the first things buyers notice when they drive up and that appraisers assess. Missing, faded, or curled shingles add nothing to the look or value to the house. If your neighbors have maintained or replaced their roofs recently, yours will look especially shabby. If the roof is in obvious disrepair, it’s in your best interest to bite the bullet and invest in new shingles.  “Doing these eight things will make your home stand out from the competition”      Clean up the yard. A well-manicured lawn with fresh mulch and pruned shrubs boosts the curb appeal of any home. Replace your overgrown bushes with leafy plants and colorful annuals, surround bushes and trees with dark mulch to give a rich feel to the yard, put a crisp edge on garden beds, pull the weeds and invasive vines, and plant a few geraniums in the pots. You also need to green up your grass with lawn food and water, cover any bare spots with seeds and sod, and get rid of the crab grass and mow it regularly.        Add a splash of color. Even a little color attracts and pleases the eyes of would-be buyers. Plant a tulip border in the fall that will bloom in the spring, and dig a flower bed by the mailbox and plant some pansies. Consider placing a colored bench or Adirondack chair on the front porch as well. These colorful touches won’t add to the value of your house, but beautiful colors enhance the curb appeal and can help you sell your house faster.        Spruce up your mailbox. An upscale mailbox, architectural house numbers, or address plaques can make your house stand out. You can get a really nice mailbox for anywhere from $50-150, or you can just repaint your current one and add new fresh home numbers to it as well. Just make sure any changes you make comply with the HOA guidelines for your neighborhood.        Fence yourself in. A picket fence with a garden gate to frame the yard is an asset. Not only will it add visual punch to your property, but appraisers will give extra value to a fence in great condition. Expect to pay around $2,000-3,500 for a professionally installed gated picket fence. If you already have a fence, make sure it is clean and in great condition. Again, be sure to check with your local HOA before you make any purchases.        Maintenance is a must. Nothing looks worse from the curb and sets off subconscious alarms like hanging gutters, missing bricks, or peeling paint. Not only can these deferred maintenance items damage your home, but they could decrease the value of your home by as much as 10%.  Doing these things will make your house stand out from the competition, and will help you put your best foot forward when you list your home on the market.",

        "title": "Do Guaranteed Home Sale Programs Really Work in Northern Virginia?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You’ve seen the signs: I’ll sell your home in 60 days, or I’ll buy it. I want to take a minute and share with you how those programs work, and what you should be aware of when considering this type of program.Personally, I don’t have a guaranteed sale program. I can’t offer something in good conscience that, in my opinion, is a bait and switch marketing tactic. I have nothing against the Realtors that use these programs, and a lot of the most successful agents in this country have some form of this program in their business plan.However, if you were to talk with several of these agents, very few end up having to buy the home from their client. Even fewer of the clients choose to list their home under these programs. That’s partly due to what’s in the fine print. There are several criteria that the seller must agree and comply with in order to make these programs work.Some of these programs include an agreed upon list price, which is solely based on recently sold properties and not current market conditions. Other programs include a pre-agreed upon price reduction every 7 days, and that can be a significant amount. Still more programs include an upfront marketing fee of $1,500 to $2,500 and pay for staging and any other things the Realtor recommends.“If this program seems too good to be true, it probably is.”In addition, the pre-agreed upon price that the agent would pay for the home is usually well below market value and includes the same seller commissions and fees as a regular transaction.The reality is that these types of programs might work for a small percentage of people, but ultimately, guaranteed sale programs are a marketing tool to get the agent’s phone to ring, and it often works. I’ve talked to several who use these programs, and they all say that it’s a huge lead generation system for them.Bottom line, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you’re a motivated seller and you’re willing to do what your agent recommends, price your home aggressively based on the current market conditions, and combine that with a fantastic marketing plan, then your home should sell.If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "The Northern Virginia real estate market got off to a hot start in 2016. The blizzard might have set us back a couple days, but the market is still doing very well. My team and I put a house on the market just before the snow started and it went under contract in 5 days. Buyers are still out there even though inventory is low. Here’s the scoop on the Virginia real estate market:Sales in December 2015 increased by about 1% with 2,845 closed transactions. Pending sales were up from 2014 by 9.5% to 2,230. New listings were also up 5%, but active listings are down by 0.8%, resulting in low inventory.In December, there were only 2.32 months of inventory on the market, which is very low for the region. According to the National Association of Realtors, housing inventory levels across the country have seen a downward trend since 2011.Despite low inventory, real estate was the best investment in 2015, getting property owners a 6.8% return. Overall, 88% of the population feels homeownership is a good financial decision.“Buyer demand is still strong right now.”While real estate is a great investment, most people want to buy real estate to have a home of their own or a place to raise their family. However, buyers are concerned about low inventory, saving for down payments, and rising interest rates. **First time buyers will be the most affected if interest rates rise. **If you are thinking of buying a home, keep in mind that it takes 49 days to close on a loan.What does all of this mean? Our real estate market is strong. There is high demand for homes and low supply. If you’re waiting for May, June, or July to sell your home, you might want to reconsider. Get on the market now. Buyers are looking, and you’ll beat the competition.As a buyer, get with a lender and get pre-qualified. You might want to wait for spring for inventory levels to rise. However, if interest rates do go up, that home you can afford today might be too expensive in a couple months. Don’t miss out because you weren’t sure what to do.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Today we are excited to talk about both the perceptions, and realities, of homeownership in Northern Virginia. The National Association of Realtors recently released a report saying Americans at every age and income level agree that homeownership is both a smart financial decision, and part of the American dream. We’ve talked about some obstacles to homeownership in the past, but as studies like this have shown, many obstacles are perceived. They aren’t real.A recent study by Fannie Mae revealed that many consumers are either unsure or misinformed regarding the minimum requirements to obtain a mortgage. We are going to break down three such challenges today.  Down payment perceptionsMany renters have mentioned that the lack of an adequate down payment is the thing that  most prevents them from buying. According to the Fannie Mae report mentioned above, 40% of all renters don’t know what kind of down payment is required, while 15% think you need at least 20% down and 4% believe at least 10% down is required. The reality is, there are tons of programs out there from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA that offer 3% down programs. VA and USDA loans offer 0% down programs. The average down payment for a first-time buyer is 6%.“The average credit score for FHA loans is 687.”      Credit score perceptionsMany renters have also mentioned that the lack of a good credit score is the thing preventing them from buying. According to the same Fannie Mae report, 54% of all renters don’t know what credit score is required, and 5% think you need at least a score of 740. Actually, many mortgages are granted to purchasers with a score below 700. The average credit score for FHA loans is 687, and the average score on all loans is 722.        Debt-to-income ratio perceptionsMany renters say they carry too much debt, but 59% of renters surveyed by Fannie Mae don’t even know what ratio is acceptable. Lenders like to see a back-end ratio that does not exceed 36% of the buyer’s stable monthly income.  All of this leads us to the bottom line: Don’t let a lack of knowledge or misinformation keep you from buying this year. If you don’t know where to start, or have any other questions about the market, we would be glad to help. Give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to being in touch!",

        "content": "Last time we covered how to prepare for winter on the inside of your home, and in this episode we’re going to discuss how you can winterize the outside of your property.You can start by performing some preventative yard maintenance. This will include raking your leaves, clearing your gutters, fertilizing your lawn, and perhaps even mowing the lawn one last time. Clearing your gutters is important for keeping snowmelt away from your foundation in the spring.It’s also crucial that you drain your sprinkler pipes so that they don’t burst during a hard freeze. You might need to hire someone to blow out your pipes if you cannot do so yourself. Right now is also a good time to touch up on the paint covering your siding, decks, and patio.“Don’t forget to clear your gutters of debris.”Something else that is often overlooked is replacing or adding caulk and weather stripping to your doors and windows. This will help insulate your home and will even save you money on your energy bill.If you have a real chimney or fireplace, have it checked by a professional to ensure that you won’t encounter a problem during the middle of a blizzard.If you have any questions about these issues, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Deep clean the countertops to refresh them for the season and get rid of those lingering cold germs.Now is also a great time to perform preventative maintenance on your heating system. It’s not a bad idea to have a service contract with a company to check your heater a few times a year, which will help prolong its life.Finally, make sure you check those smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and replace their batteries. **Also, check and purge your closets, cabinets, and garage of any unnecessary items and donate them to charity. **If you have any questions for us about winterizing your home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered what the first step in the home buying process is? Today, Tim Curtin from Americorp Mortgage Services is here to help answer that question.Before you even start looking at homes, the first thing you need to do is get pre-qualified. You simply call your lender, talk to them about what you want to do, and then they will take your personal information, income, and assets to figure out what kind of loan you will qualify for.A pre-qualification is different from a pre-approval. The pre-qualification is more of a preliminary step. A pre-approval is when the lender goes through and verifies the information you provided during the pre-qualification.The documents you need to provide to the lender include 30 days worth of paystubs, your W-2s from the last two years, two years of tax returns if you have investment income or are self-employed, bank statements from the last two months, and a photo ID.“Get pre-qualified before you look at homes.”The whole process lasts about 30 days from getting approved to taking the loan to closing. You may even qualify for more than what you can afford. The lender allows you to borrow as much as their guidelines will allow, but that might be more than you can afford. Budget out your monthly mortgage payments in order to know what you can actually afford to spend on a home.If you have any questions for Tim, you can call him at 703-930-1765 or email him at T.Curtin@Americorp-HomeMortgage.com.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you’re thinking of buying a home in the next three months or so, I’m going to give you three questions you need to ask yourself before you dive into the home search.1. Why am I buying in the first place? This is the most important question. For most people, the reason has nothing to do with finances whatsoever. People want a safe place to raise their kids. They want more space for their family, and they want control of the space that they have.      Where are home values headed? When looking at future values, the Home Prices Expectation Survey provides a fair assessment. Every quarter, a nationwide panel of economists and real estate experts make projections for the next five years. Home values will appreciate by 4% through 2015. Even the more conservative experts project an accumulative appreciation of 15.1% by 2019.        Where are mortgage rates headed? A buyer must be concerned about more than just home price. The long-term cost of a home could be dramatically impacted by an increase in mortgage rates. Mortgage rates will increase by one percentage point over the next twelve months, so keep that in mind.  “Only you can determine the best time to buy a home.”The bottom line is that only you and your family can determine the best time to buy a home. These three questions will guide you with that decision. If you have any questions for me, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, I want to discuss what a home appraisal is and why they are needed when purchasing a house.An appraisal is an unbiased professional opinion of a home’s value. In a purchase and sale transaction, an appraisal is used to determine whether a home’s contract price is appropriate given the home’s conditions, location, and features.Lenders want to make sure that homeowners are not over-borrowing for the property because the home serves as collateral for the mortgage. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage and forecloses, the lender can recoup the money by selling the home.Because the appraisal primarily protects the lender’s interest, the lender will usually order the appraisal. The value found by the appraisal is influenced by recent sales of similar homes, current market trends, the home’s amenities, floor plan, and accessibility. The appraiser must do a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior and note any condition that might adversely affect the property’s value, such as needed repairs.“An appraisal is an important part of the transaction process.”Next, the appraiser provides a comprehensive report that includes an analysis and conclusions about the property’s value. An appraisal typically costs between $400-$500, and generally, the borrower pays the fee.When you’re buying a home and you’re under contract, the appraisal will be one of the first steps in the closing process. If the appraisal comes in at or above the contract price, the transaction proceeds as planned. On the other hand, if the appraisal comes in below the contract price, it can delay or derail the transaction. Chances are, neither you nor the seller want the transaction to fall through, and as a buyer, you have an advantage in that a low appraisal can serve as a negotiating tool to convince the seller to lower the price so the transaction can move forward.If you’re a seller, it might be a good idea to get an appraisal before you list your home to get a better idea of what the current market value of your home is from a third-party perspective. When everything goes smoothly, the home appraisal is just another box to check on a loan closing checklist, which is the goal for buyers, sellers, and lenders in the transaction process.If you have any questions about this topic, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

In other words, the lower your deductible, the higher your monthly payment will be for insurance.“It is beneficial to have all your insurane policies (home, auto, etc.) in one place.”A deductible higher than $1,000 will keep you from filing claims that aren’t necessary.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Buying and selling a home is a stressful process and lots of different things can go wrong. However, a home warranty can solve a lot of these problems. Here are a few reasons why I believe that a home warranty is a good option.“Overall, getting a home warranty is a great way to secure peace of mind.”      Base plans protect systems and appliances: This is always a good thing to have, and it should provide a lot of peace of mind for you. You can also upgrade your package so that more of your belongings are protected.        Products are tailored to your geographic area: Maybe you live on a flood plain, or in an area that’s prone to fires. Wherever you are, the warranty will cover your specific area’s needs.        Service guarantee: Warranty companies provide great vendors that always do their best to provide excellent customer service. I’ve also seen that most claims made on warranties are handled quickly and efficiently. Sometimes, if they cannot respond fast enough, they’ll allow you to hire a local contractor.        Peace of mind: The biggest advantage of a home warranty is the peace of mind it allows you to have when you move into a new home. On average, every homeowner goes through two mechanical failures every year. If you have a warranty when something goes wrong, all you have to do is give them a call, pay your deductible, and you’re set.  Even if you’re selling your home, you can purchase a home warranty during the period of time that it’s on the market. This way, if something goes wrong, you can get it fixed quickly and not spend your time worrying when you’re just trying to sell your home. You can also use it as a valuable marketing tool when you sell, because buyers like to see homes that are under warranty, and it’s easy to transfer the coverage to buyers.Overall, getting a home warranty is a great way to secure peace of mind.

In my own experience, I think it’s easier to remodel than to build new, but your case may not be the same as my own.Will you be able to finance the home improvement yourself? Or will you have to take out a loan? If you need to finance your project, you will need to consider how much equity you have in the home. If you have a solid amount of equity, you’ll be able to get a line of credit or a home equity loan.What you’ll also need to think about is whether it’s feasible to remodel your home. How much will this new addition add to the value of your home when you finally go to sell it? Most additions that include bedrooms and bathrooms will be a solid investment into your home. This can make your home more marketable when you go to sell, which is an important aspect of remodeling.“In my own experience, I think it’s easier to remodel than to build new, but your case may not be the same as my own.”You’ll also need to consider your local zoning codes, because these will dictate whether you can actually build the way that you want to.
