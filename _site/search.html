I’ve invited Eric Froisland, a licensed attorney, to come back and explain estate planning in a little more detail.Looking to buy in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportWhen should you put an estate plan in place? There’s really no right or wrong time. However, Eric recommends that you start thinking about it more seriously after you’ve bought a home or had children.Another thing to remember is that an estate plan is something that you need to update continually. As your life changes, your estate plan should change too. For example, you may need to update it after you have a child or get married. Should the worst happen, you don’t want an ex-spouse or former friend to be listed as the decision-maker on your healthcare directive.“IT’S SOMETHING TO GET TAKEN CARE OF EARLY”According to Eric, a typical estate plan will cost $1,000 to $1,500. It’s something smart to get taken care of early so that your family will be taken care of no matter what happens. If you have any questions for Eric or would like to hire him to set up an estate plan for yourself, give him a call at 801-290-2130 or send an email over to froidlandtaxlaw@gmail.com.If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportI was recently joined by my good friend and client, Eric Froisland, who is also a licensed attorney in the state of Utah. I wanted him to come by to talk about a topic that you probably have a lot of misconceptions about. I know I did. I’m talking about estate planning.I think it’s really important for you to have an estate plan no matter who you are, and Eric agrees. Originally, I had thought the whole purpose of an estate plan is to keep the government out of your money and keep your family from fighting over your stuff. That’s part of it, but it’s a lot more complicated according to Eric.Your will and your trust are actually what help your family decide what to do with your things. However, there are three equally important parts of your estate plan: your advanced healthcare directive, HIPAA release forms, and power of attorney. An estate plan isn’t only beneficial to your family, but it’s also beneficial to you personally. There are a lot of gray areas out there when it comes to the advanced healthcare directive that can be exploited if you don’t have a plan in place.“THERE’S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG TIME TO GET STARTED.”A lot of people want to know if they should do their estate planning online. While it’s certainly an option, Eric doesn’t recommend it. When you’re sitting down with an attorney, they will cover issues that wouldn’t be covered by an online estate planner. Online planners will treat you more like a number in the system.If you have questions or want to discuss this further, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.",

You probably have already received your notice this year, but I wanted to make you aware of a few different things about them.“YOU’VE PROBABLY ALREADY RECEIVED YOUR NOTICE IN THE MAIL.”The first thing you’ll get is a notice in early fall. Then a month or two later, you’ll receive a property tax bill that’s typically due sometime in November or late December. It’s important to note that this bill is something that’s typically included in your escrow account. Your mortgage company actually mails out that check. Before you decide that you need to pay your property tax bill, check with your mortgage company to see if you already have.If you have any questions about this or about protesting your property taxes, I’d be glad to assist.

Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportToday, we’ll be talking with Ed Blake at Habitat for Humanity.What does Habitat for Humanity do for the community?Ed: We provide affordable housing for families in need. We don’t give them the house; they get a 30-year, no interest mortgage, and they pay back every cent we give them. Habitat for Humanity also does critical repairs, primarily on homes that are making people sick.Another service I’d like to talk about is our Habitat for Humanity ReStore, which keeps 781 tons of refuse and turns it into money that comes into our affordable housing program.A lot of this product is new; people think it’s all used or garbage, but a lot of it is actually brand-new. The story goes quite often that if you come down here and you can’t find what you want, just wait a few days—it’ll come in eventually.These are all building improvement items for homes. On the real estate side, if you hear about a family that’s going to take out the kitchen as soon as they move in, donate those materials to us. You’ll come down here and sell or donate it—you get a tax write-off for it as well—and we can also send a truck out to pick it up for you.“WE PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES IN NEED”If you’re going to to be tearing out your bathrooms or kitchens, contact the ReStore and see if it’s a fit for them to come pick up those materials. You get a tax write-off, and you won’t have to haul it to the dump and pay to get rid of it. They’ll absolutely reuse it. Beyond that, if you’re doing any home projects such as finishing or redoing a bathroom or basement, please stop by the ReStore for any number of supplies. There’s furniture, tile, cabinets, appliances, and much more.As one last final touch, who gets these Habitat homes?Ed: The people who get these homes are people in the community who are earning 30% to 60% of the area median income, families in need, and often single parents with their children, which is our largest demographic.Please keep that in mind, and if you’re looking to volunteer, Habitat for Humanity is always a great entity to work with. They are located at 1276 S 500 W, Salt Lake City, Utah 84107. You can also follow their activities on their Facebook page.If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Get a free Home Equity ReportI noticed so many great trends at Salt Lake Creative Homes that I couldn’t fit them all into one discussion, so here’s the second half of my top 10:6. Light fixtures with Edison bulbs. This was a really big one—I don’t know if there was a single home without at least one fixture with an Edison bulb in it. If you’re considering redoing your lighting, keep this in mind.7. Open shelving in the kitchen. This is a neat concept if you’re really clean and don’t have a lot of clutter in your cupboard.“IF YOU’RE CONSIDERING REDOING YOUR LIGHTING, KEEP EDISON BULBS IN MIND.”8. A free-standing tub in the master bathroom. This has been a hot trend for the last three or four years. This wasn’t in just the high-end homes—it was in several other homes in the master suite as well.9. Pendant lights in the bathroom vanity. This was a new trend this year. Instead of just the light bar, they had pendant lights that hung down in front of the mirror.10. Crystal resin doorknobs. Door hardware was a big thing. It was very rare that I saw a traditional lever or doorknob. Everyone had their own take on door hardware, and I love it because I myself was searching for hardware because we’re redoing our doors this month!If you noticed any trends I missed or have any questions about any of these trends and applying them to your current or future home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

I’ve got a top 10 list but today, I’ll just go over the first five.There are definitely a few things I noticed that are emerging as common themes in the national housing market.1. The chalkboard wall. Several homes had a chalkboard wall. Some had them in common rooms like kitchens, while other homes had chalkboard walls in children’s rooms.2. Patterned tile. I have mixed feelings about patterned tile. When I say patterned tile, I mean that the tile itself is arranged in a certain pattern or has a certain geometric shape. For several years, I’ve been telling homeowners to get rid of their 1970s patterned tile, so I’m struggling with the fact that I’ll have to do that again in five to seven years. But I guess some people think it’s cute right now.I did like the patterned tile in one home. They just had a small backsplash with patterned tile, so it wasn’t overdone. If you have to do patterned tile, I would definitely recommend that you use it in small amounts.“I RECOMMEND USING PATTERNED TILE IN SMALLER SPACES, LIKE BACKSPLASHES.”3. Wall treatments. Many people are dressing up walls with painted boards or repurposed barn wood. This is a cool way to make your room look unique.4. Gray cabinets with blue and green tones. These cabinets are really pretty and a refreshing change from all of the white kitchens we’ve seen the last few years.5. All-white exteriors. Homes are being painted in white or off-white colors. There are even some painted brick homes out there. These homes are then paired with a black or dark brown roof and gutters, which creates a very sharp look.Stay tuned for my next video where I’ll go over the last five trends from Salt Lake Creative Homes.In the meantime, let me know if there are any other interesting trends that you’ve noticed or if you have any questions.

To me, she is simply an angel for what she does. She steps up to help the alarming number of children in our backyard who don’t have enough to eat.Did you know that there are 55,000 children in the Salt Lake Valley that qualify for a free lunch from the state every day? Lynda figures that at least half of those kids could benefit from food on the weekend and their numbers are proving that to be true.What they do is pretty simple. They take backpacks and fill them up with seven balanced meals consisting of everything from fruit cups to graham crackers to macaroni and cheese. They then take these backpacks and distribute them to places like The Boys and Girls Club and elementary schools.“THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION.”Even with all the work Lynda has done, she still hasn’t been able to feed all of these hungry kids. She needs our help to do this. I’m a big believer in this cause, and I’m proud to support it.They go through a whopping $4,000 per month in food and distribute anywhere from 100 to 150 backpacks. If you’d like to support KidsEat!, you can do so right on their website. Whether you can donate time, money, or food, just know that you are helping to give a lot of these kids what so many of us take for granted.KidsEat! also has a charity golf tournament coming up on September 15th at Murray Parkway. You don’t need to be an expert player by any means.

I was in a different part of the house at the time, so before I smelled the gas, it had already been leaking into most of my house for a good 10 minutes.All it took for me was a little Googling to solve this problem but if this kind of thing happens to you and catches you off guard, here’s what you need to do to keep everyone in your house safe.“TAKING CARE OF THESE TASKS CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAGEDY AND NEAR-TRAGEDY.”First, open all of the windows regardless of how cold it is. Then shut off all the gas appliances. After that, check everyone in the home for signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. Symptoms include lack of consciousness, vomiting, or nausea. If none of those symptoms are present, evacuate the house and allow the home to air out. You can call the fire department and have them check the home for leaks if you’re not sure where yours is coming from. If this happens during winter, make sure you turn the furnace off.Taking care of a few simple things can mean the difference between tragedy and near-tragedy. Lastly, remember to have up-to-date smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in your home.If you have any questions about carbon monoxide safety, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Get a free Home Equity ReportThe theme for 2016 was “The year of the refinance” with interest rates being so low. Now, people are saying that 2017 is going to be the year of the buyer. Things are certainly shaping up that way, here’s how.For starters, we all know millennials are getting into the market and purchasing homes at a much higher rate than they have in the past. There are a few interesting statistics to note, including the fact that the national average rent rose from $950 a month to $1,040 a month in 2016 alone. That’s nearly 10%!“BUYING A HOME PROTECTS YOU FROM CONTINUALLY RISING INTEREST RATES.”The odds are that when investors are buying properties, now with higher rates, they are passing those costs along to the renters. Renters may think it’s smart to wait to buy until rates go down, but the truth is you’ll still be paying those higher rates in the form of higher rent.If you rented last year, how much equity did you earn? The answer is none. Purchasing a home is an investment that’s nearly always appreciating in value. A 30-year fixed rate stays the exact same over the life of the loan, save for some taxes and insurance.If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking about buying a home in 2017, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportIf you plan on buying a home in 2017, that’s great news. However, there are a few things that you should know before you make the decision. We’ve got seven tips to share with you today that will help you become a better buyer. We’ve got tips for budgeting, tips for home maintenance, and tips for working with a lender.1. Meet with a lender you trust. This could also be a lender that your Realtor trusts. You want to establish a game plan, know what type of loan product you’re going to get, and what you need for a down payment. There are a lot of down payment assistance programs out there.2. Automate your down payment savings. Make them as relatively untouchable as possible.3. Build up and clean up your credit. You don’t want to be sidelined when the time comes to buy because your credit needs work. A good lender will check your credit and if there are any problems, they will work with you to find a solution.“BE READY TO POUNCE WHEN IT’S TIME.”4. Practice living on the budget of your estimated payments. This is a good exercise to use to determine if you can handle the monthly payments on your current income.5. Get familiar with home maintenance. If you’re a first-time buyer, you don’t necessarily need to know everything it takes to maintain a home, but it’s a good idea to get familiar with it.6. Create your wishlist and must-have items list. Compare those lists to the homes currently on the market, and get familiar with the homes that match your criteria in your target areas.**7. Be prepared to pounce when you are ready. This is the final step, but it’s the most important one. The market is active and competitive. We expect our trend of low inventory to continue.If you have any questions for us or would like to discuss this topic further, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "There is a lot of misinformation out there about short sales. I’m here to clear the air.Looking to buy in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportWhenever I hear multiple buyers starting to repeat the same misinformation, I start to notice a trend coming about. I never know where the info is coming from, but I know it’s wrong. Today I want to clear the air a bit on a few things I’ve been hearing about short sales.Oftentimes, buyers tend to think that short sales are the best strategy to get a deal when buying. 85% of the time, that’s not true. Short sales are unique and different from other sales for a few reasons, such as:1. In a traditional sale, homes that sit on the market and don’t sell typically reduce their prices. For short sales, this doesn’t typically happen because the balance the owner owes continues to rise as long as the short sale goes on. If someone is in foreclosure, they are not making payments. This causes interest and penalties to continue to accrue.“SHORT SALES ARE UNIQUE SITUATIONS.”2. Most of the time, the loans on these homes have mortgage insurance protecting the bank from losing too much money. This doesn’t give them a lot of motivation to drop their price significantly. You’ll be paying at, or just below market value for a home that may be in major disrepair. It might not even have a clean title, which will cause you to have to pay off any liens on the title. Ultimately, the bank could just decide to foreclose on the property at any time as well.Before you hang your hat on the short sale bargain dream, remember they can take up to 13 or 14 months, and make sure you’re educated on what the process is like and an individual home’s situation.If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Frozen pipes are a pain. Here are a few tips to help you avoid them this winter.Looking to buy in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a full Home SearchLooking to sell in the Salt Lake City Area? Get a free Home Equity ReportAs the weather starts to get colder, we want to bring you some tips to prevent you from having to deal with the nightmare of frozen pipes. I learned a few things from a report I recently read, and I want to share them with you.One typical preventative measure to take is getting a pipe sleeve that goes on a water line attached to an exterior wall. You can pick one of these up at Lowe’s or Home Depot, or you can just use newspaper as insulation if you’re in a pinch.“Pipe sleeves can work wonders.”There are quite a few things you can do in order to take preventative action against frozen pipes. One is keeping your garage door closed, as pipes are sometimes connected through there. If you have a bathroom or sink that is attached to an exterior wall, keep those bathroom cabinet doors open on cold nights and let the faucet drip just a touch to prevent freezing.If you’re going away or out of town, always remember to keep your thermostat to at least 55 degrees.Hopefully these things can help you and hopefully you’ve learned a thing or two in the process. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",
