How did I hear about Team Lally?

I first heard from my cousin, Veronica Edwards, who is a buyer’s agent here on the team. Then, I did my own research and found out that it’s the No. 1 real estate team in Hawaii.

What motivated me to join the team?As I mentioned, Team Lally is the No. 1 team in Hawaii whose team leaders are using advanced home search tools to stay ahead of the competition. They also use a home-selling device and professional expertise to provide services to our clients.

“I love the culture here.”

What is my role on the team?I’m a buyer’s agent who works exclusively with buyers, representing them and their best interests, as well as educating them on the current market conditions.

What do I enjoy most about working on the team?

I love the culture here. I love the constant growth and learning from the top producers to improve my negotiation skills, as well as having fun and connecting with the community.

If you have any questions for me personally or are looking to buy a home, feel free to reach out to me at 808-633-2368. I’d be glad to help you.

Meet Benjy Gilholm, one of our great agents here at Team Lally.

When Benjy first heard about our team, he was working at another top real estate team here in Honolulu. During that time, he noticed his team was referring all of their short sales over to agents on our team.

Benjy took note of our good reputation and decided to make the switch. What ultimately motivated his move to our team was that he didn’t want to be a solo agent anymore. Being part of a team where you have a specific duty is something he was definitely attracted to.

“At Team Lally, we create great experiences.”

Team Lally has a “great team environment that is based around continuing education,” says Benjy.

As a listing partner for our team, Benjy specializes in getting listing agreements signed and properties sold.

The thing he most enjoys about working with Team Lally is our atmosphere. According to him, “We create great experiences.”

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I want to talk to you guys about video marketing and how you can use videos to leverage your overall business in the real estate industry.

Initially, I wanted to talk about this subject using PowerPoint slides, but to really bring the point home, I decided to make it into a video. The great thing about doing this on video is that I won’t get that awkward silence when I ask for questions or feedback. What’s more, if someone misses something, they can go back and rewatch the part they missed or didn’t understand fully.

Today, I’ve got four tips for you, which I turned into the acronym SEER (Story, Educate, Entertain, and Retention). Hopefully these tips will make your video marketing more effective in your business life.

Since there’s a lot to cover, I’ll timestamp each section so that you can learn about each one at your leisure—yet another awesome aspect of video!


  Story (1:40)—make your videos revolve around a story. 
  Educate (2:34)—come from a place of education. 
  Entertain (3:35)—make your videos as entertaining as possible. 
  Retention (4:03)—edit your videos so that the audience will watch the whole thing. 
  7:28—hear examples of ideas I have that utilize SEER. 
  8:30—a note about potential compliance and legal issues that you might come across if you don’t perform your due diligence.


Personally, being in front of a camera is very awkward for me. Even though I’m uncomfortable doing it, it’s going to improve my speech, communication skills, my knowledge of the industry, and so much more.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact me via phone or email, or keep an eye out for my future video blog posts. Thank you all so much, and have a great day!

Are you a real estate agent who wants to build wealth, bring balance to your life, stabilize your income, and increase your profits?Well, we’d like to invite you to attend our Agent Profitability Workshop. In this workshop, we’ll be giving away all our systems that you can use to build a profitable real estate business.

These will be hands-on, nuts-and-bolts strategies that we use every day, day in and day out. These strategies will help you run an efficient business and bring some balance into your life.

We will show you how to embrace the mindset and the habits of a successful business owner.

Isn’t that what you deserve? What your family deserves?

“We will show you how to embrace the mindset and the habits of a successful business owner.”

There will be an opportunity to ask us any questions that can help you grow your business.

At the end of the workshop, should you feel the need for a one-on-one consultation for help in putting together a business plan, we would be happy to schedule that.

There is absolutely no obligation to meet with us, just our way of coming from contribution.

Please RSVP here. Seating will be limited, and our workshops do fill up quickly.

There is only one catch—you have to show up.

And here is our promise: If you execute on everything we teach, your success will be certain.

We look forward to meeting you in person at our next Agent Profitability Workshop.

        <description>

Today we’d like to introduce our buyer specialist Miranda Haws.

Miranda first heard about our great success on the radio from hosts Rick Hamada and Sean Hannity. Once she’d heard about us, she began to think about joining our team.

Miranda was curious as to what set Team Lally apart from other real estate teams here in Hawaii. Most agents compete against each other, but here at Team Lally we compete for each other.

This is just part of the reason why we’re so successful. The opportunity for collaboration that this mindset brings is what Miranda says she enjoys most about working on our team.

Each agent brings something different to the table, so everyone on the team combines their experiences and outlooks to find the best solutions for any transaction.

“On Team Lally, everyone brings something different to the table.”

In her role as a buyer specialist, Miranda works with families who are looking to purchase homes.

To help find the home that will best fit their criteria and lifestyle, Miranda sifts through a number of properties before finding the right ones to show them.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Adrienne+Lally/Hawaii+Real+Estate+Agents-+Meet+Veronika+Edwards.mp4</guid>
        <description>

Our newest team member, Veronika Edwards, was born and raised in Russia and came to the U.S. at age 19. Her life took her all over the country until she settled in Clarksville, Tennessee, where she got her real estate license in 2007. Even though she entered the business at the worst possible time, her passion, determination, and persistence helped her assist over 150 families in making their American Dream come true.

The housing crisis helped Veronika master her skills quickly to be able to help her best assist her clients’ needs. In 2016, her husband’s military job relocated her family to Hawaii. Veronika has two beautiful kids, ages four and nine months. She’s worked with many families with different life situations and understands how to provide her clients with “Raving Fan” level customer service. Her number one priority is exceeding her clients’ expectations. Today, we want you to get to know her a little better. We sat down and asked her a few questions recently—here’s what she had to say:

How did you hear about us? I heard about Team Lally from my previous team leader, who thought I would be a great fit. I did my own research as well to find the best in Hawaii.

“We’re excited to have her on the team.”

What motivated you to join our team? Team Lally’s track record and reputation. Team Lally has the proper systems and tools in place to keep me organized and professional.

What is your role on the team? I’m going to be a buyer specialist who helps families find their dream home.

What do you enjoy most about working on the team? Team Lally is a place that is jam-packed with motivation, ambition, success, and inspiration. Not only do they want you to grow as a businessperson, they want you to grow as a person in general. The environment is so warm and welcome. I feel like I’m part of a big family.

If you want to learn more about Veronika or if she can help you with any of your real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Today we wanted to introduce you to Miranda Haws, one of our beloved inside sales agents here at Team Lally.

Miranda heard about Team Lally from the radio and also by seeing our yard signs throughout the community. She was motivated to join us after hearing about our success as the No. 1 team in Hawaii.

“I had to come and see what all the rave was about,” she says. “It turned out that Adrienne and Attilio are just really down-to-earth people. They care about the team and they care about their business.”

“HER FAVORITE PART OF THE JOB IS THE COLLABORATION EVERYONE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.”

As an inside sales agent, Miranda works hand-in-hand with buyers and listing agents to help guide our clients to the best resources and all the information they desire. Her favorite part of the job is the collaboration everyone brings to the table from their many years of experience.

“Any time there’s a problem or conflict that comes up, we can all work together to figure it out,” Miranda says.

If you have any questions for Miranda or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in Hawaii, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help!

Have you thought about starting a career in real estate? Here’s how to approach it to set yourself up for a prosperous career.

Today we want to talk for a minute about a career in real estate.

People always ask how the market is and whether now is a good time to get into real estate. A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market we’re in.

Here’s what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.

It’s not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success. How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.

“WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.”

That is an example of having the right strategy—we adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.

We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference? Our business does not go up and down with the economy, but rises upward with strategic growth. How do we do that? Come to one of our Career Nights or check out JoinTeamLally.com to learn more. We’d love to see you there!

Thanks and Aloha!

        <description>

Benjy Gilholm is a great listing partner on our team.
Hear from the man himself about how he came to join our team.

We are excited to introduce another great member of our team. Benjy Gilholm is a listing partner with Team Lally and he is going to talk about what led him to us today.

Benjy had actually heard about us first in 2008 when he was working for a different team. His team referred all their short sales to us. The first thing that attracted him to us was the fact that we did a good job with those referrals and had a stellar reputation for doing so.

“Benjy’s number one goal is taking care of his clients.”

The thing that gave Benjy the fire to actually join our team was listening to our Sunday morning radio show. Benjy joined us as a listing partner because he loves getting on the phone, getting people into properties, and helping sellers list their homes successfully. His number one goal is always to take care of his clients.

Benjy loves the team environment and the fact that the process of joining our team was so competitive. He looks forward to closing 180 homes this year and continuing his success in the future.

If you have any questions for Benjy or if you’re looking to get your home on the market, give him a call at (808)-647-0002. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Talk to you soon!

        <description>

Keli’i Lum is a buyer specialist here at Team Lally. What he enjoys most about working with us is the atmosphere and support we provide.

Today, we wanted you to get to know a little bit about Keli’i Lum.

How did you hear about Team Lally?
A while ago, I decided I wanted to be a real estate investor, so I went to a real estate seminar and thought to myself: “I want to get out there and hit the real estate market and start selling homes and buying homes. Everything under the sun dealing with real estate.” So I went to these seminars and they advised reaching out to a real estate company and spending six months or so learning from professionals within the industry.

What motivated you to join Team Lally?
They’re among the top teams and top companies in Hawaii, and that’s what led me to go out there and join them. If you want to be the best, you have to learn from the best. I want to serve my clients and customers the best way I possibly can.

“IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST, YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM THE BEST.”

What’s your role on the team?
I’m a buyer specialist. I’m here to help buyers get into homes, educate them about the process, and get them into a comfortable state so that by the time we get to the end, they’re a happy customer.

What do you enjoy most about working on a team?
I love the atmosphere here. There is a lot to learn from a team. With a team by your side, you have a lot of support. There is a pool of information and experience you have access to that as a single agent you wouldn’t have access to. What’s even better, it’s a lot of fun being on a team!

If you have any questions for Keli’i or need help buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

*What does it take to be a leader instead of a manager?

You can start by asking questions instead of giving answers.*

Today we wanted to give you some helpful information on how to be a leader.

Managers give answers –  Leaders asked questions
Managers manage work –  Leaders lead people
Managers develop subordinates –  Leaders develop other leaders
Managers dictate plans –  Leaders cast a vision
Managers insist on control –  Leaders inspire collaboration

Managers are also accustomed to being the go-to person for answers they’re used to given direction and giving their opinion it makes them feel valued important and reinforces their position of authority.  Also some managers prefer to deliver answers because they think that it will save precious time.

Unfortunately when managers routinely dish out the answers they become enablers that to a dysfunctional cycle.   Which is actually a huge time waster now because team members regular have to seek out the manager for solutions rather than being problem solvers themselves.

“Stop giving answers and start asking questions.”

This prevents the ability to develop real solutions. Stifles the team member growth and ultimately limits the organization’s productivity. Additionally when team members are used to going to the manager for answers and direction they actually transfer the ownership of the problem from themselves to the manager. Consequently they can then blame the manager for the goals shortcomings and failures.

It is no longer their fault because they didn’t provide the solution.  The manager did. Assigning team members with the task of uncovering the reason for their list goal or creating a viable solution to a problem challenge puts the responsibility back where it ultimately belongs.   So how do you do all this by not providing answers.  Instead answer every question with a question. Teach people to think and learn and grow for themselves.

Click on this link we’ve provided to a Darren Hardy video to learn some awesome concepts from him on how to be a great leader.

He mainly talks about training your people to be problem solvers. Darren also talks about how managers give answers while leaders ask questions. He recommends that you stop giving answers because when your team members problem solve on their own, they take ownership of the problem.

If you have any questions give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Brooks Bowman is a Listing Partner here at Team Lally, and
he enjoys the camaraderie of working on a team very much.

Today, we wanted you to get to know a little bit about Brooks Bowman.

How did you hear about Team Lally?
I first heard about Team Lally when I was in a brokerage of my own about six or seven years ago. I watched Adrienne and Attilio thrive during the market collapse of 2008 and 2009 when quite a few of us were being taken down. During that time, they built a great business, so I was very impressed.

What motivated you to join Team Lally?
I was motivated to join Team Lally because of their success. They have a great track record and they’re extremely successful in the marketplace. As I was wondering about the future of my own brokerage, I would see their signs all over my own neighborhood and the surrounding areas.

“I joined Team Lally because of their success.”

What’s your role on the team?
My role on the team is as a Listing Partner. That means I work with owners and sellers but not with buyers.

What do you enjoy most about working on a team?
I enjoy working on a team because of the efficiency it produces and the camaraderie it provides. Each transaction is dealt with in such a way that so much gets done in such an efficient manner. Additionally, the team ends up becoming your friends and family. I have many friends here on Team Lally, and I enjoy that. Experiencing the negotiation of transactions with our chief negotiator Howard Net has been phenomenal. All of the other agents and our administrative staff have been great to work with as well.

If you have any questions for Brooks or need help buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

If you’ve never heard of the millionaire mindset, now’s the time to learn.

One of the key aspects of the millionaire mindset is having a strategic game plan that will smooth out the ups and downs of each economic swing. That being said, we want to personally invite you to a class that will teach you about growth, mastering the millionaire mindset, and negotiating real estate shifts. At this class, you will learn about five specific things you can do now to maintain a profitable business in a down cycle.



“Don’t be unprepared for the inevitable market shift.”

Don’t be one of those agents that’s unprepared for the inevitable market shift. We have personally implemented these strategies, and they work. The only regret that you’ll have after attending this class is that you didn’t learn this information sooner.

If you have any questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you. Thanks, and Aloha!
