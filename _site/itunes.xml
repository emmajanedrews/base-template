Today we discuss the availability of deals on foreclosure homes and why they’re harder to find than in years past.

Today I’d like to talk to you about the topic of foreclosures and about whether or not there are still good deals available on foreclosures.

If you’d asked about foreclosure deals four or five years ago, I would have said there were tons out there, and half of what sold at the time were foreclosures.

However, in today’s market, it’s a little bit of a different story. Foreclosures are becoming harder to find. The ones that are out there, if they’re priced-well, are receiving lots of interest and likely have multiple offers thrown at them. Investors and homebuyers are bidding those prices up.

It’s harder to get the deals on foreclosures now than what we saw a few years ago: Is this a good or a bad thing?

“IT’S HARDER TO GET THE DEALS ON FORECLOSURES NOW THAN WHAT WE SAW A FEW YEARS AGO”

If you’re looking for a deal, it’s a bad thing because of how hard they are to find.

In the grand scheme of the economy and the real estate market, however, it could be seen as a good thing. It shows that the market is improving, prices are rising, and homeowners are no longer underwater like they were a few years ago because the values have increased, which has helped them be able to sell, instead of being forced into foreclosure.

We are still working with buyers who are getting great deals on homes, so if you are looking for something, reach out to us. Oftentimes we hear things before they officially hit the market. It may or may not be a foreclosure—it could just be a motivated seller.

If you’re in the market for a new home, let us know, and we’ll help you find a good deal.

Downsizing may be a natural and smart choice to make, but that doesn’t make it easy.
There are a lot of things to think about.

Today I want to talk about the topic of downsizing. When the kids leave the nest and it’s just you and your partner left, you may start wondering why you’re still staying in such a big space. When you no longer need a large home, the natural option is to downsize.

However, even once people no longer have a need for such a large space or so many items, it can still be hard to adjust to change. People grow used to living a certain way, which makes downsizing difficult.

Going from a 4,000 square foot house to one of half that size means that half of your personal items will have to go as well. This is something a lot of people have difficulty with.

It’s important to realize that these are the kinds of things you’ll need to be thinking about. The idea of downsizing is good and smart, especially since it sometimes helps people to become debt-free, but it isn’t as easy as many people think.

“WHEN YOU NO LONGER NEED A LARGE HOME, THE NATURAL OPTION IS TO DOWNSIZE.”

Another thing that often takes people by surprise is the change in amenities. In a downsized home, the kitchen may not be quite as nice as the one in the previous house. This is just one example.

It really depends on what you buy, but it is possible to find a nice, smaller home in a lower price point.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We continue to be in a seller’s market, which is affecting how appraisals come in for homes under contract. I’ll explain everything in today’s video.

Today I wanted to talk to you about what’s going on with appraisals in the current market. In our last video, we gave you a snapshot of what the market currently looks like from a supply and demand perspective.

Currently in our market, we have high demand and a low supply of homes, which is causing home prices to increase. So how is this affecting appraisals for the sellers that we work with? We’ve had more instances this year than in recent memory where we get a home under contract for a certain value, and the appraisal comes in lower than that value. This is a problem.

Why are we seeing lower appraisals? Appraisers are looking back over the last three to six months of sales in the area, comparing similar homes to the seller’s, and coming up with their opinion of the value of the home based on those factors, as well as any improvements or updates done to the home.

“CURRENTLY IN OUR MARKET WE HAVE A HIGH DEMAND AND A LOW SUPPLY OF HOMES.”

In my opinion, the true market value of a home is what the seller and buyer agree on, but the banks have to protect themselves. Because of this, we’re seeing these low appraisals. I still continue to encourage sellers to list their home at a price that is a little higher than the homes that sold recently in the area, especially in this current market.

If you find yourself in that situation where the home appraisal is lower than the purchase price, you have a few options to take care of that problem. You can reduce the price down to the appraised value, the buyer can pay that difference in cash, or you can meet somewhere in the middle. Some buyers aren’t willing to pay the extra money, and the low appraisal can kill your deal.

If you get a cash offer for your home, it might be worth it to really consider taking that deal. Most cash buyers don’t spend the extra money on the appraisal, so you don’t have to worry about it.

If you have any other questions about this topic or there is anything we can do for you, a friend, or a coworker, give us a call. We’d be happy to help!

With how our market’s been acting lately, there’s no better time to be a seller in one of the median price points.

As I’m sure you’ve probably heard, the market has been going gangbusters lately, and I want to share some numbers to help you get a sense of what’s happening.

When you hear news about the market going crazy and prices rising, that’s usually referring to what’s happening in the median price points. Homes in higher price points aren’t selling as quickly, however, and prices at those higher price points aren’t rising as dramatically either. This is because demand isn’t the same for higher-end homes.

These latest numbers, then, represent the activity in our market’s median price point.

In East Athens, there are only 31 single-family homes currently for sale under $200,000, which is a little over one month’s supply of inventory. In the last 12 months, 293 homes have sold in this area. With supply this low and demand still high, it’s naturally caused prices to rise.

In West Athens, there are only 27 single-family homes for sale under $200,000. These homes encompass all age ranges and sizes, too—some are new, some are old, some are large, and some are small. In the last 12 months, 238 homes have sold in this area.

“NOW MIGHT BE THE BEST TIME EVER TO SELL YOUR HOME IN THE MEDIAN PRICE POINTS.”

In Oconee County, there are only 11 single-family homes for sale under $200,000. In the last 12 months, 84 homes have sold in this area. I believe there would be more sales in this area if there were more homes on the market. In addition to making prices rise, this low inventory is almost stifling sales.

If you’re thinking about selling your house in this price range, now’s the best time to do it in the last 10 years—maybe even ever.

If you’re a buyer, you have to be ready to act fast and make a strong offer if you see something you like. With inventory as it is, many homes are receiving multiple bids and flying off the shelves quickly. Times may be tough, but if prices continue to rise, you’re much better off acting now.

If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help you.

There are a ton of mistakes that can happen when buying a home for the first time. Here are the three most common.

I wanted to reach out to you today and discuss some bad buying habits I’ve been noticing. It’s typically the first-time homebuyers making these mistakes so if you are one of those buyers or know someone who is, we have some advice to share. Avoid these mistakes at all cost:

1. Not getting pre-approved before looking at homes. It can be tempting to just head right out to a home or start searching online, but know this: if you plan on buying a home with a mortgage, you’re going to need a loan. The only way you will then know what kind of loan (and home) you can afford is by meeting with a lender and getting pre-approved. Skipping this step will only lead to heartache, as you could fall in love with a home that’s way out of your price range without even realizing it.

2. Choosing the wrong lender. We always align ourselves with great local lenders and we want our buyers to do the same. The problem with a national or Internet lender is that if they drop the ball in one area and the closing is delayed, they will end up costing you a lot more than they initially saved you. A respected local lender won’t let your closing get delayed.

“YOU NEED A MARKET EXPERT AS AN AGENT.”

3. Choosing the wrong agent. You need someone who is an expert on your specific market. I couldn’t sell homes in Atlanta. I sell homes in Athens because I know exactly how things work here. I’ve been helping people buy and sell homes for years in this market and there is no replacement for that kind of knowledge and experience. You need an agent who can find you homes as soon as they come on the market—sometimes even before they are listed.

If you avoid these mistakes, you’ll be starting off on the right foot and be one step closer to a smooth closing. If you have any questions for me or want to know how we can help you avoid these mistakes and more, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

Are the rumors true? Have we decided to branch out into property management? Well, I’ve got some exciting news to share with you.

You may have been wondering—are the rumors true? Are we doing property management? I’m excited to announce that we have opened up a second brokerage that will focus on strictly managing rental properties for clients. We’ve named our sister company Iron Horse Property Management.

I had clients come to me for years asking me to branch out into property management, and I was always hesitant because my main focus was on sales. I wanted to be great at sales and make that the main focus of Woodall Realty Group.

Now I feel like the timing is better than it was in the past. The reason for this is our sales team is staffed with four full-time agents in addition to myself, our systems and processes are really dialed in, and we helped over 200 families last year. We expect to help even more families this year, and our business is steady enough that I felt we could finally branch out into property management.

A big concern that I’ve had was that I didn’t have the time during the day to focus on the daily aspects of moving tenants in, handling repairs, moving tenants out, and all the things that come along with property management. My solution was to find and hire a great property manager who has years of experience and, in my opinion, is one of the best in Athens, Jennifer McMahon.

“YOU’LL GET THE SAME GREAT SERVICE THROUGH IRON HORSE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT THAT YOU GET THROUGH WOODALL REALTY GROUP.”

Jennifer has worked with two other property managers in Athens over the years and has done a great job. She’s a go-getter, a hard worker, and she will be handling the day-to-day aspects of the property management. She’ll be taking care of all of the things that you as a landlord don’t want to do and help things run more smoothly.

So, now we will be able to offer the same great service through Iron Horse Property Management that you get through Woodall Realty Group. If you have rental property that you’re managing yourself, or you’re dissatisfied with your current property management, give me or Jennifer a call.

Our goal with Iron Horse Property Management is to give you peace of mind while maximizing the return on your investment. We want to make owning rental property a completely passive investment for you so that you just receive income each month and not have to worry about it.

If you or someone you know has questions about Iron Horse Property Management or any other concerns, give us a call. We would love to be here for you.

If you put less than 20% down on your home purchase, you are paying private mortgage insurance. However, there is a way to get rid of it.

I’ve got a tip to share with you today that will potentially save you thousands of dollars on your mortgage payments.

If you’ve bought your house in the last decade but put less than 20% down on it, you’re probably paying private mortgage insurance, or PMI. At this point, you’re probably not even thinking about it, as it is rolled up into your monthly payment. It costs you $100, maybe $150 per month.

However, once you pay down the balance on your mortgage to a 78% loan-to-value ratio or once the value of your home increases enough to cross that threshold, you can eliminate having to pay PMI for the remainder of your loan term.

“IT’S A SMART IDEA TO HAVE YOUR HOME RE-APPRAISED.”

How do you do this? Just contact your mortgage lender and ask them to have the home appraised once again to eliminate your PMI. If you bought your home in the last 10 years, especially around 2011 or 2012, it has risen significantly in value. If you’re currently paying PMI, you should look into eliminating it. It will save you thousands of dollars over the loan’s term.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, I want to give you five quick, easy tips on how to prepare your home for the market.
1. Clean up and clean out. Wipe down your trim, blinds, ceiling fans, etc. Make sure all of your surfaces are spic and span. Also, if a room has too much furniture, move it out before you show the home. When selling, less is more.

2. Improve your curb appeal. Trim your bushes, cut your grass, paint your shutters, and put out fresh mulch or pine straw. A buyer’s first impression is of the outside of your home, so take the time to make it look neat and well taken care of.

3. Get professional photos taken. Buyers will see various qualities of photos when searching for homes online. Professional photos make a home stand out online and are more likely to convince a buyer to see your home in person.

“IF A BUYER CAN’T GET IN TO SEE YOUR HOME, THEY’LL JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.”

4. Be willing to accommodate showings. Your home needs to be show-ready at all times, and if a buyer calls, you need to let them see it when they request to. The market is very active right now, so if a buyer can’t get in to see your home, they’ll just move on to the next.

5. Price your home properly. Don’t price it too low or too high. Find a good agent, do your research, and make sure you know what the market is doing. Prices are rising rapidly in our area, so you need to make sure you get a professional opinion on what the value of your home is in the current market. This will keep you from selling yourself short and from pricing yourself out of the market.

If you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell a home or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

If for whatever reason a home doesn’t appraise, here are each side’s options in how to proceed.

What happens when a home doesn’t appraise?

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, the first order of business is to make sure the appraisal was done correctly. Our local appraisers do a good job, but occasionally we’ll get an out-of-town appraiser who doesn’t know the market or just does a bad job. However, if it’s determined that the appraisal was legitimate, what are each side’s options?

If you’re a homebuyer, as long as you’re still in your appraisal contingency, you have three options:


  Ask the seller to adjust the price down to the appraised value. If they agree to that, we adjust the price and you buy the house for less than what you thought you were going to.
  Terminate the contract if the seller doesn’t agree to lower the price.
  Bring additional cash to closing and purchase the house at a higher price. The lender will only loan on the appraised value or the purchase price—whichever is less. Say you’re under contract for $210,000 and the appraisal comes back at $205,000. On top of your down payment, you’d also have to bring in an additional $5,000 to bridge that gap between $205,000 and $210,000 because your loan will be based off $205,000.


“WHETHER YOU’RE THE BUYER OR THE SELLER, EVERYTHING IS OPEN TO NEGOTIATION.”

If you’re a seller and the buyer is still in their appraisal contingency, you also have three options, but they’re the inverse of what the buyer is facing:


  Reduce the purchase price down to the appraised price.
  Refuse to lower the purchase price, in which case the buyer has the option to either walk away or pay extra.
  Negotiate between the appraised price and the purchase price and end up somewhere in the middle. Remember—everything is open to negotiation.


We work with good, local appraisers and lenders, so most of the time this situation doesn’t happen. If we do have a problem, though, we know how to work through it and resolve the situation for both parties.

If you have any questions about this topic or there is anything I can do for you whether you’re a buyer or a seller, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

Home values are on the rise in the Athens market, but rising values can often signal appraisal issues. Here’s where our market currently stands on that issue.

The Athens market is improving and prices are on the rise. However, rising prices can cause issues with appraisals. Any time a property changes ownership and the buyer gets a loan, the lender will require an appraisal. So are properties appraising now that values are going up?

Our experience has been that properties aren’t having appraisal issues on either the buyer’s or seller’s side. Of course, you want a house to appraise because you want the deal to work out.

Sometimes, sellers are concerned when I tell them that they can price their home above what past sales show due to low inventory. The concern is that the house won’t appraise at a value above recent sales even if it sells at that price. So how does that work?

“AN APPRAISER’S JOB IS TO JUSTIFY A HOME’S SALE PRICE TO THE BANK.”

The appraiser knows the purchase price of the contract before they perform the appraisal. It sounds crazy, but what it boils down to is that when a bank hires an appraiser, their job is not to determine the value of the property (the market determines value), but to justify that price and value for the bank. The bank wants to be sure they don’t lend more money on the house than it’s actually worth.

When the appraiser knows the purchase price, their job is to pull sales and make adjustments to show that the purchase price is a realistic, fair market price that the bank won’t be overpaying for. Most of the time, as long as an appraiser can do this within the appraisal guidelines, they will. Most of the time, we’ve been coming out OK.

Next time, we’ll discuss exactly what happens for buyers and sellers if a house appraises low. In the meantime, if you haven any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Athens area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!

Today we’re taking a look back at the Athens area market statistics from 2016 to try and get a feel for where our market is and where it might be headed in 2017.

As we head into 2017, I wanted to take a moment to look back at the most important statistics from the Athens market in 2016. Now, a lot of agents can be procrastinators and haven’t yet entered all their year-end data into the MLS, so this data might not be perfect yet.

As of early January, these numbers won’t change much even as agents add in late sales data from 2016.

In Clarke County, the average sales price went up 9.8% to about $202,000. Almost 1,500 units sold in 2016, roughly 8% more homes sold than in 2015. In Oconee County, we didn’t see as many sales simply because the population is smaller. Prices rose about 6.8%, from an average of $312,000 to $333,000 in 2016.

“IF YOU’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING A MOVE IN THE ATHENS AREA, THE TIME IS NOW.”

When you look at the Athens area as a whole, it was a good year with the average sales price rising 8.4% to $225,000. Overall, we’re seeing prices rise, and that’s a great thing. We’ve certainly needed it after being in a slump for a bit.

We’re also seeing good appreciation, so if you’re thinking about buying a house, you probably should have already done so. It’s time to stop waiting.

If you’ve thought about selling, this time is the best time in nearly the last 10 years. We hope prices will continue to rise, but we really don’t know what 2017 and 2018 will bring. As of now, things are looking up with the economy improving.

If you’ve been thinking about making a move in the Athens area, the time is now. Give us a call or send us an email today. We’d be glad to help.

        <description>

As we enter 2017, I foresee interest rates continuing to rise and inventory staying low. However, as you’ll see, it isn’t all bad news.

Now that 2016 is at an end, what can you expect from the real estate market in 2017?

One prediction everyone can seemingly agree on is that interest rates will continue to rise. For buyers, this means you might be better off buying sooner rather than later. Buying sooner means locking in a lower interest rate and making your payments better for the entire life of your loan.

“IF YOU’RE A BUYER, YOU MAY WANT TO ACT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.”

This trend could cause sellers who are already locked into a really good rate in the home they currently inhabit to opt out of moving to avoid a higher interest rate and a higher payment with their next home.

Currently, inventory levels are really low. There aren’t a lot of homes available, especially in the lower and more average price ranges. These price ranges are a firm seller’s market. As you get into the higher price ranges, though, we’re still in a buyer’s market. As the economy improves, we may see more activity in these price points. Activity in this area has been slow up to this point, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that improves in 2017.

As rates rise and sellers settle in, that will probably make our low inventory problem even worse. I do believe that inventory levels will stay low in 2017, and home prices should continue to rise. If demand starts to subside, however, that may stymie the overall price increase. In the meantime, builders are acting far more conservatively.

Part of me feels like this market resembles the one we had back in 2006 and 2007, when prices were rising and everybody was getting rich buying and selling. The key difference, though, is that lenders are now asking for far more documentation from buyers than they were back then before they issue a qualification. Buyers, in turn, are far more qualified than they were a decade ago. That distinction alone might prevent us from entering the same recession as we did after that market peak.

In addition to home prices, rent prices have also been rising. If that continues, we may see more first-time home buyers entering the market who would rather own a home than deal with landlords increasing their monthly rate.

Lastly, more and more affluent buyers want to live close to town and in walkable neighborhoods. For Athens, this means the hospital area, the Five Points area, and the Boulevard neighborhood.

As you know, my team and I opened our brokerage this year, and 2016 was fantastic for us. We’re looking forward to having the same success in 2017. If you or anyone you know is interested in buying or selling, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!

Are there options to buy a home with 100% financing? Are there funding opportunities for these properties and rehab costs?

If you’re considering buying a house as your primary residence to live in, there are definitely options to get 100% financing or very close to it.

If you’re thinking about buying a house to flip or own as an investment property, it’s more difficult to get 100% financing. It’s possible, but not easy.

A hard money lender may loan you up to 65% or 75% of a home’s value after repair. This means you’d need to buy the home for significantly less than what it’s worth, then, have an appraisal done to show the hard money lender that it’s really worth more than what you paid.

“THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR 100% HOME FINANCING.”

For example, if the value of a house is $100,000 after repair but needs $25,000 worth of rehab, and the hard money lender is loaning you $65,000, you would have to be able to buy that house for $40,000. As you can see, it’s tough to buy a house at a priced that low with no money down. Additionally, hard money loans are much more expensive in terms of interest rate and fees.

If you have 20% to put down on a home, a lot of local banks will fund the purchase and the rehab cost since that 20% is a significant amount of skin in the game for you.

Finally, there is the option of finding a partner. If you can find a partner to provide the cash on the condition that you do the legwork, it could be a win-win.

Hopefully, that clears things up for you about 100% financing options for buying a home and some alternatives to it. If you have any questions about this topic or about Athens real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help!

What does it mean when you see a house listed for sale with tenants’ rights? If the home changes ownership, the lease must be honored.

We always love answering your questions, so this week, I wanted to address a question from a viewer who asked about homes that are advertised with tenants’ rights. They wanted to know what specifically the landlord owes the tenant and what the obligation is for the buyer.

So what does this mean? If you’re looking online, you’ll often see listings with tenants’ rights. When you see this, it means there is a tenant renting the house. Most of the time it’s under a lease, but occasionally it may be on a month-to-month term without an actual lease. Regardless, it means that there is a tenant currently in the home.

“WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE THAT HAS A TENANT, THE LEASE STAYS WITH THE HOUSE.”

If you buy a house that has a tenant, the lease stays with the house. If their lease runs until December and you buy the home in September, you assume that lease. In this case, the tenant would start making their payments to you through the end of December. If you’re buying as an investor, it’s a great thing because you’re buying a house that is already providing income. If you’re buying the house with the intention to move into it, however, you have to wait until after December when the tenants’ lease ends unless you’re able to work out a mutual agreement for them to terminate their lease or leave early.

Simply put, tenants’ rights mean that you have to abide by the terms of the current lease when you buy a tenant-occupied home. If the tenant is on a month-to-month basis, Georgia law says that the landlord must give the tenant 60 days notice to vacate.

This is really important information to keep in mind if you’re buying an investment property or you’re just buying a house with a tenant in it. If you have any more questions about this topic or you have any questions at all about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
