        <title>9 Ways to Cut Energy Costs This Summer</title>

If you’re looking to cut energy costs for the summer season, here are nine useful methods that will save you money without sacrificing comfort:

1. Plug any holes you may have in your house. Use plastic film on any drafty windows or just replace them if you have the budget, as leaking air is one of the biggest ways energy gets sucked out of your house and costs you money. Foam and caulk any other problem areas you see, like gaps around your doors and windows and around your outlet plates.

2. Close the shades. Anything that keeps the sunshine from coming directly into your house will help lower your energy costs.

3. Keep your filters clean. You should check your AC filter at least once a month to make sure it’s clean and you should be replacing it as necessary. This way your air conditioner isn’t working twice as hard to circulate cool air throughout your house.

4. Program your thermostat. If you aren’t home, you obviously don’t need it to be as cool as when you’re there, so feel free to raise the temperature a little bit. Only about half of all people actually take advantage of their programmable thermostat, which is unfortunate because it’s a cheap and effective way to reduce energy costs. Also, overhead fans can circulate and cool air a lot more cheaply than a low thermostat, so don’t forget to use them if you have them or install a couple to help keep your air just how you like it.

“If you aren’t home, you obviously don’t need it to be as cool as when you’re there.”

5. Unplug, unplug, unplug. Computers, TVs, mobile devices, and any other devices such as these that are plugged in can use up energy while they’re not in use. Unplug them when you don’t use them and you’re not around so they’re not drawing energy while you’re not there.

6. Cut back on oven usage. Using a grill or outdoor cooktop instead will reduce the amount of heat being generated in your house.

7. Turn down the thermostat on your water heater. Lowering the temperature from—say—130 degrees to 115 degrees can save you around $50 a year, which can add up over the long term.

8. Get your HVAC tuned up. Don’t ignore your air conditioner until something goes wrong with it, because if it malfunctions when it’s 100 degrees out in San Antonio, you’ll want someone to fix it right away, and it will probably cost you a lot of money to get that done.

9. Upgrade your systems. This means things like changing your light bulbs and replacing major appliances like your refrigerator, washer, or dryer. If and when you do, make sure you check out the energy efficiency rating of these items before you buy another so its replacement has a higher rating.

If you have any questions about cutting summer energy costs or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the San Antonio market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.

        <title>5 Obstacles to Buying Your First Home</title>
        <link>http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/5-obstacles-to-buying-your-first-home.html</link>

        <description>

Buying a home is not always an easy process, and there are many obstacles that a first-time homebuyer may encounter.

The best thing you can do is be prepared for those obstacles. An experienced agent can help you find the right home, negotiate for you, and guide you every step of the way. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t encounter any wicked witches or flying monkeys while you’re on the yellow brick road to homeownership.


  
    Finding a down payment. Unless you’re independently wealthy or have just won the lottery, you will probably have to get a mortgage to buy a home. VA loans are the only loans that allow you to purchase a home with no money down, and you need to be active or retired military to qualify. Most loans require some kind of down payment. The most popular loans are FHA loans and conventional loans, which require anywhere from 3% to 20% down.
  
  
    Obtaining a minimum FICO score. You need at least a 620 FICO score for an FHA loan, and you need a 720 score for a conventional loan with mortgage insurance. However, if your FICO score falls below that, you may still qualify for a mortgage; you will just have a higher interest rate or different requirements that you have to meet.
  


It’s important to talk to your lender about your credit score, as online credit scores may vary. Get pre-qualified with a lender before you start looking at homes, even if you don’t plan on doing so for another six to 12 months. That way, you can identify any issues with your credit that you may need to repair and you can get some guidance from your lender to make sure that you’re doing everything you can to get the house that you want.


  Meeting lender ratios. Most lenders have a certain ratio that you have to meet. Your PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) ratio for your mortgage payment cannot exceed 33% of your monthly gross income. Some lenders accept higher than that but again, that is something you need to check with your lender. For example, if you earn $5,000 a month, then the max PITI payment you could qualify for was $1,650.


Your back-end ratio includes your PITI ratio with all of the debt that you pay on a monthly basis. That ratio should fall between 41% and 50%, depending on your lender and the type of loan you are looking for. If you don’t want mortgage insurance, you typically cannot exceed 41%; to qualify for a higher back-end ratio, you can put 20% down.

There are always exceptions to the rule, however, so make sure you work with a lender that you trust.

“Make sure you speak with a trusted lender before you start looking at homes.”


  Receiving an appraised value. The appraisal occurs after you’ve gone under contract. Before May 1st, 2009, your lender could select their own trusted appraiser that was experienced and comfortable giving appraisals in the area. As a result, you would get a fair and balanced appraisal.


However, a new home valuation code of conduct allows appraisal management companies to pluck an appraiser from a random pool. Your appraiser may be from another area and not know anything about the neighborhood that you’re buying in, which could result in a low appraisal. That’s tough for buyers and sellers alike, but that is the world we live in.

If the appraisal does not come in and the seller does not adjust the price, you can walk away from the transaction, pay the difference in cash, or meet the seller in the middle. Homes often don’t appraise in our current seller’s market, as home prices continue to increase.


  Satisfying your loan conditions. Underwriting can be frightening. An underwriter will review your file and make demands that you might not have even known about. At that point, you’ve probably already gone through your home inspection and your appraisal. When the underwriters come back with conditions and requirements, don’t get upset. They may need more documents or they may have rejected the loan for any number of reasons; they write the rules.


For example, if you’ve remarried but your former spouse went through a short sale or foreclosure with your name on the mortgage, you may be disqualified for your mortgage.

That’s why it’s important to disclose everything about yourself and your finances to your lender so that the loan officer will be able to foresee any problems down the road. You can also get a full underwritten approval before you look at homes to make the whole process easier for you.

These are just a few of the most common obstacles first-time homebuyers may encounter. If you have any other questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <title>6 Tips for Buying in a Sellers Market</title>

The real estate market often fluctuates, so planning for mistakes in advance is smart. It’s tough to predict whether the market will favor buyers or sellers when it’s your turn to buy.

If it’s a seller’s market like the one we are seeing right now, buyers can get what they want. However, they need to bring their A-game and be decisive in order to do so. Here are six common mistakes we see in a seller’s market like this and how you can avoid them:


  
    Not making your best offer up front. The motivation to buy for as little money as possible is deeply ingrained in us. When buyers see a high list price, they naturally wonder if they can get a better deal. Offering less than asking price is a reasonable strategy in a buyer’s market, but it doesn’t work quite as well when there is a shortage of inventory. In fact, it doesn’t work at all. Competition is fierce, so come in with a strong opening offer if you really want to get the home.
  
  
    Overanalyzing the purchase price. This is ill-advised because the longer you take to make an offer, the higher the risk of losing the home you want. Once you’ve determined the type of home you want, the location you desire, and the right price range, don’t wait to make an offer. Be prepared to move quickly by having your finances in order and being pre-approved.
  
  
    Work with an experienced agent. A lot of people make the mistake of not doing this, and it costs them. If you have a seasoned agent on your side, they will give you a better chance of getting the home you want. In Texas, sellers pay the commissions for their agent as well as yours, so it costs you nothing out-of-pocket to have an experienced professional advising you on the best course of action to take.
  


“Low offers won’t do a thing for you in this market.”


  
    Not being pre-approved. This is a common problem. With the market moving so fast, you’re going to lose out on a lot of great homes if you’re not pre-approved. Without that letter in hand, most agents and sellers won’t even entertain your offer.
  
  
    Not being prepared for a bidding war. No buyers want to be involved in bidding wars, but they are inevitable in this kind of market. Start your search below your maximum budget so you have room to up your offer.
  
  
    Not learning from your mistakes. It’s easy to get frustrated by repeatedly declined offers. Learn from prior offers and transactions so you can move into your dream home.

Moving to a new town can be difficult. There are just so many different things to keep track of that it can get confusing. There are probably even a few things that you’ll completely forget about until the moving truck is all packed up and ready to go. Here is a list of five things you might not have thought about, but you should definitely complete before you leave:


  
    Banks. Check to see if your bank has a branch in your new city. If they don’t, you may need to find a new one.
  
  
    Medical needs. If you can, have your doctor call in your prescriptions to a pharmacy in your new town. Keep your old doctor’s number handy in case you need to contact them to forward any paperwork in the future. If you’re keeping your health insurance plan, look for doctors in your new area that accept your insurance. If you need to switch providers or update your plan, try to do it before moving.
  
  
    Things to transfer. Transfer memberships from local organizations, gyms, associations, and clubs. Be aware that you may have to pay an early termination fee on some of those. Factor that into your moving costs.
  
  
    Raid the kitchen. About a month before moving day, start using up frozen or canned goods so you don’t have to let anything go to waste. Donate any unopened, non-perishable food to a local food pantry.
  


“Don’t let the food in the freezer go to waste!”


  Check the car. Give it a tuneup to avoid a breakdown on the way to your new home. If you have a trusty mechanic, ask that they refer you to another one near your new home. Pack a first aid kit just to be safe.


These are just a few of the things that you should do before you move. If you have any questions or want any more tips, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>What Will Happen If Rates Go Up?</title>

        <description>

Over the past few months, there has been a lot of buzz about potential interest rate increases. First, they were predicted to go up last September. That didn’t happen, but they did go up in December. Nobody knows if or by how much rates will go up next time, but we do know that they will still be historically low.

It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will increase rates in 2017. Even if they go up by 1% or 2%, it won’t affect our market much. There are three reasons why:


  Mortgage rates often move independently of the Fed rate.


“A small increase in rates won’t affect our market much.”


  
    Any increase in rates will be small. Whether they go up by 0.25% or 0.5%, they will still be historically low.
  
  
    A shortage of inventory. With a limited supply of homes out there, the Fed will keep the health of the real estate market in mind before taking any action.
  


In short, the market is doing great right now and it’s likely to stay that way for the rest of the year, regardless of what happens with interest rates.

If you have any questions for me or want to take advantage of current market conditions, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

As a homeowner, it’s important that you keep up with home maintenance. It’s especially important when you are preparing to sell your home. Here are six tasks that you should take care of today:


  
    Apply a coat of fresh paint throughout the house. Fresh paint will go a long way and make your house show very well. Spiff up the walls, cabinets, doors, and trim. Make sure you eliminate scuff marks.
  
  
    Redo your laundry room. Take advantage of every square inch of the laundry room. Make sure the room is clean and organized so that it looks as open as possible. Don’t just leave a big pile of clothes in there.
  
  
    Clean out your dryer vents and ducts. Not only will you take care of a dangerous fire hazard, you will also lower your utility costs.
  
  
    Clean your refrigerator coils. Save energy and improve the longevity of your fridge’s life.
  


“Make sure your laundry room looks clean and open.”


  
    Give your mattress some love. Flip the mattress, rotate it, and vacuum the coils so that the mattress is fresh and comfy.
  
  
    Look for leaks. Inspect the roof for missing tiles and damaged vent hoops. You should also check out your foundation. If you’re not sure how to inspect your roof, take a flashlight into the attic and look for leaks. That can help you determine if you need to address any issues with the roof.
  


Taking care of these six home maintenance items will make your home more appealing to buyers. Even if you are not selling for a while, these six tasks will improve your home and make it feel fresh.

        <description>

Today I want to talk a little bit about buying a fixer-upper. Is it worth it? How can you tell?

The first thing you want to do when considering purchasing a fixer-upper is evaluate the price. Do your homework to make sure you can afford the project.

Treat the remodel like it’s a business, not a hobby or a get-rich-quick scheme. Determine the after repair value, the value of the home after it’s repaired, based on the market values of the homes in your neighborhood.

Next, start evaluating what improvements are needed. Some projects, like painting and landscaping, have more sweat equity involved and will give you more bang for your buck.

Get accurate estimates for professional projects such as getting a new roof or putting in new floors before you commit to buying the house. Those projects can add equity, but they can also be very expensive.

“Treat the remodel like it’s a business, not a hobby or a get-rich-quick scheme.”

Stress is a huge factor when taking on a fixer-upper, so you need to make sure you can handle it. There are hidden costs that always pop up during a remodel, so having some extra money set aside will help keep things running smoothly for you.

Lastly, hire an expert to help you through the process. Have someone who is familiar with fixer-uppers help you make decisions in order to stay on a clear path and stick as closely as possible to your budget.

If you have any other questions about fixer-uppers or if you have any other real-estate related questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help.

Staging your home is incredibly important when selling. Today, I’ll go over six tips to help you stage your home for top dollar.


  
    First impressions are the only impression. It’s important that people feel warm and welcome when they approach your home. You only have one chance to make a first impression, so make sure the exterior of your home is clean and fresh for the spring market. Declutter your entryway, trim trees and bushes, and add some fresh mulch to your yard. These are cheap, easy ways to spruce up your exterior.
  
  
    Always be ready for home showings. You never know when a buyer is going to walk through that door, especially since so many schedule showings at the last minute. Before you leave for work each day, make sure that all of your beds are made and that the kitchen and bathrooms are picked up.
  
  
    Kitchens and bathrooms really do sell homes. Small updates, like new paint or hardware, can make a dated kitchen look like new. Updating to stainless steel appliances or bronze fixtures can make a huge difference to buyers.
  


“Depersonalize and declutter your house.”


  
    Take the home out of your house. That means you should remove any personal items, like personal photos. Invest in a storage unit and get rid of about a third of your stuff. Pull stuff out of your closets so that they appear half empty. The more open you can make your home, the better it will be for showings.
  
  
    Conceal animal accessories. Not everyone likes animals in their home. If you have pets, the best rule of thumb is out of sight, out of mind. I also recommend that you get some air fresheners. You might not be able to smell your pets, but buyers will definitely detect the pet odor in your house.
  
  
    Hire an informed real estate agent with an aggressive marketing plan who will price your home right. Pricing and marketing are key to selling your home, and if you follow the other five tips as well, you can sell for top dollar.
  


If you have any other questions about selling your home, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

What should buyers look for in a San Antonio home?

We often see buyers look for homes with window dressings or modern fixtures and appliances. These are great, but it’s just as important to look at these three factors when you choose a home:


  
    Resale value. Don’t just think about the house you buy, think of it as a house you’ll have to sell in the future. Consider the neighborhood, the pricing, and the size. Buying the biggest and best house in the neighborhood could present major issues down the road when selling.
  
  
    Make sure the house is structurally sound. It should have good windows, doors, floors, and roofing, and should not have water spots on the ceiling or cracks on the inside or outside walls. Look for the house that has the best ‘guts’ rather than just looking at the design. Always have a home inspection to make sure you’re not overlooking something that could be a costly headache down the road.
  
  
    Cost of repairs. Plumbing, heating and cooling, roofing, and water heaters are all very costly systems to repair or replace. Make sure they’re all inspected and addressed during the inspection period of the home buying process before you’re fully committed.
  


If you have any other questions about the important things to look for in a home, or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the San Antonio market, give me a call or send me an email. We’d be happy to help.

        <title>5 Tips for Keeping Your Home Safe While on Vacation</title>

        <description>

While you’re relaxing on a tropical beach or strolling through a quaint European resort during your holiday vacation, thieves could be planning on invading your unoccupied home and ruining more than just the vacation. The good news is that there are five easy steps you can take to make sure that you don’t come back to an empty house:


  
    Get a Wi-Fi doorbell. Products like the SkyBell actually videotape any visitors that come to your front door and sync that video to your smartphone so you can keep a watchful eye. Not only are these devices cheap, but they are also easy to install. I would recommend buying one for your home at all times—not just during vacations.
  
  
    Utilize exterior lighting. A well-lit property is less likely to be an attractive target for potential intruders. Motion-activated lights that pop on whenever they detect movement are an excellent deterrent. A watchful spotlight will send any unwanted visitors scurrying.
  
  
    Let your (trusted) neighbors know that you’ll be gone. If those that live closest to you know that you’re away, they’ll likely monitor your home for any strange noises or unfamiliar faces skulking about and alert the police is they see any suspicious activity.
  


“Check once, check twice, and after that, check one more time.”


  
    Alter your mail and newspaper delivery service. You can either call your mail service provider and temporarily suspend your deliveries or ask one of your neighbors to pick them up for you as they arrive. An overflowing mailbox and a pile of newspapers are sure signs that no one is home.
  
  
    Double-check that all doors and windows are locked before you leave. Statistics show that roughly 33% of all home invasions happen through an unforced entry, meaning they likely occur through an unlocked door or window. A good rule of thumb is to check once, check twice, and check one more time before you and your family depart. If you have kids, this step is especially important.
  


Following these steps will help you rest easier while you’re away and ensure that everything is safe and sound when you come back. If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!

        <title>Our Top 3 Tips for Selling Your Home in the Winter</title>

        <description>

There are several things you can do to prepare your home to sell in winter. Here are our top three selling tips for this time of year:


  Pay close attention to your curb appeal. When it comes to styling your front porch, there is a slippery slope between a nicely decorated porch and a farmer’s market. The idea is to enhance your curb appeal, not obscure it. While too many fall decorations will take the focus off your home and its best features, a few tasteful accents will make your home feel inviting and fresh.


You also want to make sure that all of the fallen leaves haven’t taken a toll on your yard. Buyers may be understanding if your yard is unkempt because they are dealing with the same thing, but that doesn’t mean your home will make a good first impression. Do your best to make sure your yard is neat and tidy before showings.


  Go easy on the holiday displays. Tasteful displays will show the home in its best light. Outfitting your home to compete with the Griswolds will make your home a spectacle, but won’t necessarily make it sellable.


“Keep the lights on during the short, dark winter days.”

So, let in the light. Always make sure that your blinds are open and the windows are sparkling when trying to sell your home. It is especially important to maximize the light in your home during the shorter days this time of year. Light will make your home look larger, fresher, and highlight your home’s best features. Place plenty of lamps throughout the home for additional illumination.


  Make your space inviting. As the weather cools down, a warm and cozy atmosphere will make the buyers feel at home. Use plush throws on the couch and beds and add fall-accented pillows to your chairs. You can even display fall foliage or seasonal fruit in vases or bowls throughout the home.


These tips will definitely help your home appeal to buyers this fall and winter. If you have any other questions about the home selling process or about real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <title>Energy and Maintenance Savings: Part 1</title>

        <description>

Today I wanted to share with you the first nine of 17 things you can do to immediately reduce your home’s energy and maintenance costs as the first installment of a two-part series.


  
    Check the insulation in your attic. Most homes have between six and nine inches of attic insulation, but here in South Texas, you should have 12 to 14 inches for the temperatures we have.
  
  
    Lower the water temperature to 120 degrees on your water heater. This will save energy and prevent anyone from getting scalded or burned accidentally.
  
  
    Put a water heater blanket on the water heater to keep the heat in. These blankets are cheap but effective in keeping the heater two to three degrees warmer.
  
  
    Install ceiling fans in most rooms. This is especially important during the summer to keep air circulating through your house. This will actually keep the house one to two degrees cooler without turning down the thermostat.
  
  
    Wrap any water pipes with insulation. We find that a lot of water pipes—exterior pipes included—are exposed since we don’t have as many freezing issues like they do up north, but occasionally, it does freeze. This will prevent freezing issues and keep hot water insulated.
  


“These things will save you maintenance and energy costs.”


  
    Install a programmable thermostat and learn how to use it. People have reported average savings of 20% to 30% on heating and cooling costs. Nest and Honeywell both make good programmable thermostats.
  
  
    Replace your air filters. This is especially important in Texas because we use our air conditioning so much. Look on the side of the filter for the dimension and go buy several at a time. Depending on the thickness, you can go 30 days to six months between replacements.
  
  
    Make sure all vents are clean and clear of dust and obstructions. None of your vents should be covered, because if they’re blocked, your A/C and heater will have to work overtime to heat and cool the rooms. Dust them off at least once every other month to get rid of allergens and increase airflow.
  
  
    Check all toilets for constant running and check sinks and plumbing for leaks. A toilet running constantly will cost you money in the long term, and you should also look under the basin of all homes for leaks. Dripping sinks can cause mold and other issues.
  


All these measures will help save you time and money when it comes to maintenance and energy costs. If you have questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Stay tuned for part two, where we’ll discuss the rest of the items on this list.

        <description>

There are three questions every buyer should ask themselves:


  Why am I buying a home in the first place? This is truly the most important question to ask. Forget about the finances for a minute and focus on the reason you’re considering purchasing a home. For most, the reason has nothing to do with money. A recent survey revealed that 75% of parents said that they were looking for a home because their child’s education is important and they wanted to find a place that supported that primary need. What does owning a home mean to you? What non-financial benefits will you gain from owning a home? The answer to these questions should be the biggest reason that determines whether you should buy a home or not.


“A buyer should be concerned with more than just price.”


  
    Where are home values headed? According to the latest home price index, home values are projected to increase by about 5.3% over the next 12 months. Simply put, if you’re planning to purchase a home that costs around $250,000, that same home will cost an additional $13,250 if you wait until next year. Your down payment will have to be higher as well to account for that higher home price.
  
  
    Where are mortgage interest rates headed? A buyer must be concerned about more than just price. The long-term cost of a home can be dramatically impacted by even the smallest increase in mortgage rates. With rates being historically low right now, it’s a great time to buy and lock in a low rate on a 30-year mortgage so that you’re protected by the lowest possible rate that you can get.

If you have your home listed on the market and the listing expires, what do you do?

You really have three options; re-list right away, re-list in a few months, or give up and decide not to sell. Some people will hire the same agent they’ve used in the past when their listing expired, and some will find a new agent. Regardless of your situation, it’s important to know that your home will fall into one of those three categories.

“Expired listings almost always fall into one of three categories.”

We always recommend that home sellers interview two or three different agents before making another decision. This will help them realize what went wrong in the first place. If you give an agent six months to sell your property and they can’t sell it, you’re probably going to get the same results if you hire them again.

Then again, it could indicate that you either aren’t priced right or your house needs some updates to make it more marketable. You want to choose an agent based on their strategy, marketing plan, and confidence level.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, or you’ve tried to sell and your listing expired, feel free to give us a call for a free consultation. We’d be happy to help you.

        <title>What to Consider When Shifting from Renting to Buying</title>
        <link>http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/what-to-consider-when-shifting-from.html</link>

        <description>

If you’re currently renting a property and thinking about making the shift toward owning a home, there are a few things you should consider.

When you’re looking to get out of your lease and take advantage of the market, it’s best to start early. Talk to a lender and get that pre-approval process started as soon as possible. You want to find out exactly what your budget is going to be so that you know what you’ll be able to afford and what you will be comfortable spending. The key in any transaction is knowing your buying power.

If your lease is up in 30 days, you certainly can buy a property, but that is going to be a very challenging transaction on short notice, unless you’re paying cash. Get pre-approved early so that if you have any problems with your credit, you can get them fixed before you buy.

You may also need more time to save for a down payment. It’s best to start looking for homes at least 90 days prior to the end of your lease in order to allow yourself time to find and close on a home. Remember, a lot of things can come up during the buying process. Inventory in San Antonio is very low right now, so finding that perfect place may take longer than expected. Starting everything ahead of time will never hurt your transaction; it can only help.

“Starting ahead of time can only help your transaction.”

You may be wondering when you should talk to your landlord about your decision to end your lease. Some landlords may allow you to break your lease early, while others may not be so generous. With rental rates increasing in the San Antonio market, it’s okay to move out – especially if you’ve been in the area a long time. We recommend talking with your landlord and checking your lease terms early. You’ll want to determine whether there is an early termination fee or if you’ll have to give notice within a certain timeframe. An open conversation with your landlord will really help the transaction go smoothly.

Finally, it’s never too early to talk to an agent about what the home buying process looks like. Your agent will help you figure out what your upfront costs, like your down payment, inspection and appraisal costs, are going to be. You should also discuss your timeframe. If you’re making this decision with someone else, it is important to have this discussion early on so that everybody involved in the transaction is on the same page.

If you have any questions regarding this or anything else, please give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you out!

        <description>

Today I’d like to discuss the difference between buying what you need and buying what you want in a home.

The easiest way to determine your home needs is to take a quick assessment of the space you’re already living in. This will help you realize what you’ve been missing, and what you may need in your next home. Make a list of your needs and ask your agent to begin shopping based on those needs.

“Today we’re living in our homes for longer than we used to.”

On average, Americans live in a house for about nine years. Interestingly, that number has increased by three years from just a decade ago when the average time was six years. This means that we’re staying in our homes for just a bit longer than we used to.

Remember, you can always trade up a few times before you find the ultimate home, but you don’t want to end up “house poor” either. Be sure that you don’t overextend yourself.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation. We’d be happy to help you.

If you are planning on buying or selling a home, should you work with a solo agent or a real estate team?

Working with a team is very important because it gives you the best shot at reaching your real estate goals. If you’re a buyer, a buyer’s agent with a team behind them has the time and energy to focus on finding your perfect home. Every morning, our buyer’s agent scours the MLS for properties that match your preferences and sets appointments on your behalf.

Individual agents will be busy taking listings and doing paperwork for other clients. As a result, they will not be as attentive to the MLS and might miss your perfect home. Sometimes solo agents can get so overwhelmed that you will be lucky to find anything you like on the MLS.

“Real estate teams are made up of specialists to guide you through the transaction.”

When you’re selling, work with a listing agent who has a team behind them. These listing agents are able to work solely on your behalf. They won’t be distracted by representing buyers and finishing tedious paperwork like an individual agent would be.

Teams are also made up of specialists who work to ensure that each part of the transaction is handled well and in a timely matter. For instance, our team has a marketing specialist whose only job is to maximize your listing’s online presence and get your home in front of as many buyers as possible. Our team also has a dedicated transaction coordinator to handle all of that tedious paperwork.

There is a lot to the home selling and buying process. Many new individual agents get buried in paperwork and other behind-the-scenes tasks, which makes them unable to fully service their clients. Today’s market is awfully complex, which makes it all the more crucial that you hire a specialized team to handle your real estate needs.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today I’d like to talk to you about setting a realistic budget.

Just because the bank pre-qualifies you for a certain amount of money doesn’t mean that you can afford to make that payment every month. Before hitting the streets for a house hunt, you should sit down and make a monthly budget of your expenses. Calculate a number that you are comfortable with spending on your mortgage payment, and work from there.

A quick and easy way to do this is to make sure that you are not spending more than one-third of your gross income on your house. If you spend more than this amount on the house, you risk becoming “house poor,” meaning that you barely have enough money to pay for your house and not enough for much else.

“Don’t spend more than one-third of your gross income on your house.”

It’s also a good idea to keep six to nine months of mortgage payments in the bank, plus a little extra for any repairs that you might need to make. Most Americans don’t even have one month’s payment in savings, so if you’re able to do this, you’ll be in very exclusive company.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Buying a home is not just about the money that you spend up front. It’s also about the rest of the money that you have to spend beyond that.

One of the biggest expenses that you’ll have to incur on a monthly basis is your property taxes. You’ll want to find out, then, what your monthly property tax rate will be before you purchase the home. Additionally, it’s also a good idea to ask the seller before you purchase for copies of their utility bills from the previous 12 months so that you know what they will cost, you and you can budget accordingly.

“We always recommend that you get a home warranty.”

Another thing that might factor into extra ending costs is if there is a homeowners association fee. Whether it’s monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, you’re going to want to know what that will cost as well.

If you’re going to furnish the property, you need to make sure you have a budget for that. Finally, if you’re buying a home that’s a little bit older, you need to budget for more than the normal amount of upkeep. This is why we always recommend that you get a home warranty on a home when you purchase it.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation. Have a great day.

        <description>

Do you need permits to build a deck, shed, fence, or other additions to your home? The short answer is probably, but it really depends where your property is located.

For example, a house outside city limits probably won’t need a permit for most of these additions if there is no Homeowners Association. However, if the house is in an HOA, there are likely building restrictions and application requirements you need to go through in order to get these projects approved.

“If you are in an HOA or inside city limits, you will most likely need to obtain permits.”

If you are inside the city limits, you will definitely need to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate entities in order to make those additions to your home.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Your kitchen is the heart of your home, and buyers will always gravitate towards it during a showing. Before you sell your home, you can squeeze out a little extra money by investing in some kitchen repairs. Here are a few things you can do that won’t require an entire remodel of your kitchen but will still net you a decent return.


  
    Amp up your appliances. Buyers want to see upgraded stoves, ovens, microwaves, and refrigerators. Stainless steel is all the rage right now, and it looks great when all of the appliances match.
  
  
    Refresh your cabinets with a new coat of paint. White is a nice touch and it can brighten up your kitchen for a welcoming feel.
  
  
    New countertops are always great. This is especially true if you still have laminate or vinyl. There are many cost-effective alternatives to granite that have the same look and feel.
  


“Small changes in the kitchen can bring big returns.”


  
    New flooring is also something that can change the look and feel of your kitchen. Tile is preferable, and shoot for 18x18 instead of 12x12. Wood floors are also desirable.
  
  
    An updated faucet is always a nice edition. Go for oil-rubbed bronze or brushed nickel.
  


An updated kitchen will certainly attract buyers. You know that people gravitate towards the kitchen in a home, so pay attention to yours. It might be as simple as replacing knobs on cabinets. You would be surprised what just a few small changes can do for the overall feel of your home.

Today we’re discussing HOA’s, what they are and what are the benefits of them in San Antonio.

HOA stands for Homeowners Association. This is typically a governing set of rules and regulations for a housing community. Its primary purpose is to keep the community looking nice, thereby preserving and protecting your property value.

They would also be responsible for maintaining any common areas, walking trails, pools, playgrounds, etc. for enjoyment of the residents of the community. They can also make sure the residents keep their yards maintained and their home’s exterior looking good.

“The primary purpose is to keep the community looking nice.”

Most all HOA’s have a fee associated with them, as well as a governing set of documents you’ll want to read before buying in that neighborhood to ensure you’ll be ok with restrictions. For example, many HOA’s don’t allow RV’s or boats to be parked outside, so check for little things like that.

If you have any questions for us about HOA’s, or about real estate in general, we would love to hear from you. Give us a call or send us an email to get in touch!
