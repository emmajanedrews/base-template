        <description>

Recently, we’ve had a shortage of inventory. This has led to a lot of bidding wars due to the hot competition over our currently limited supply.  

One option buyers are turning to in these competitive times is asking the help of parents and other family members.

With the help of a family member, many young buyers are able to beat out the competition by putting forward cash offers. Of course, the mortgage can always be refinanced after closing, but this is a great way to secure a deal.

“A great way to beat out the competition is by putting forward cash offers.”

If you’re unable to pay cash, you can also write an offer with fewer contingencies and a strong down payment. This is another thing that can make your offer stand out in today’s hot market.

I hope keeping these tips in mind will help you as you enter our low inventory, high demand market. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>What Can You Expect From Your Home Inspection?</title>

        <description>

If you’re a homebuyer in our area, it’s important that you get an inspection for the home you’re buying because most of the homes in our marketplace are older.

Typically, you’ll have 17 days to check out the house and complete the inspection. We have several great inspectors we’d be glad to refer you to if you’re in search of one.

“Which inspection contingencies you’ll deal with depends on the property being inspected.”

Which inspection contingencies you’ll deal with depends on the property being inspected. A further roof inspection might be recommended, for example, or you might need to check out the property’s sewer line.

If the property has been remodeled recently, you can also have your Realtor pull the inspection permits to see what’s been done.

If you have any more questions about inspection contingencies and the inspection process, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

I’m joined today by my preferred lender, Brian McKim over at SkyLine Home Plans, to talk about the Fed’s recent interest rate increase and how it’s going to affect you.

In case you haven’t heard already, the FED raised rates by .25% this week. However, this has been long expected and has been priced into the market for the last few months. The FED also announced that they would probably raise rates again two or three times in 2018.

Even though the FED has increased their rates, mortgage interest rates have not been affected.They remain excellent and still near historic lows. We don’t expect any major changes in the mortgage rate market for the time being.

If you have any questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

We are very fortunate to have great families, good jobs, and warm homes to go to during the Holidays. Unfortunately, this isn’t a reality for everyone in our area.

That’s why we always help the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. Every year, they provide over 1,000 turkeys to families in need. This is our seventh year in a row, and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon!

We need your help! If you’d like to donate your time or some turkeys, please get in touch with us.

As always, refer to us as your No. 1 resource for real estate in the LA area!

Happy fall!

Now that the season has changed, it’s time to look back on our market and update you on what’s happening now.

In short, we had a phenomenal summer. Interest rates dropped back down to historic lows, and buyers are out there still buying away.

“Homes are still very much in demand.”

At the moment, properties are moving off the shelves in the lower and medium-priced markets. There’s a bit of a softening in the higher-end markets, but homes are still very much in demand.

If you have any questions about our LA market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

This is Courtney Korb with the Brad Korb Real Estate Group today I’d like to answer 5 important questions about HOAs.

First, what are the costs involved? Membership in an HOA requires a monthly fee that you’ll pay on top of your mortgage payment. Make sure that you’re financially comfortable adding this fee to your monthly budget.

Second, know what is being covered. Are they covering water? Are they covering landscaping? Depending on the complex, different items will be included.

“HOAs are always looking for new residents with new ideas to take part in the committees to try to make their community look even better.”

Third, what are the rules of the HOA? Many will have guidelines concerning pets, how many units are allowed to be rented out, etc. Be sure to ask about any restrictions.

Fourth, are you happy with how the complex looks? The HOA is responsible for appearances. Are the trees trimmed? Is the paint there? Are everyone’s patios looking nice? Consider these factors as a potential new resident.

Finally, can you get involved? Every HOA has a board of directors made up entirely of members living in the community. Are you willing to step up? HOAs are always looking for new residents with new ideas to take part in the committees to try to make their community look even better.

If you have any questions about HOAs, or are looking at townhomes or condos, we would love to help you. Please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you soon!

        <description>

If you’re a homebuyer in today’s market, you need to focus on doing five specific things in order to have the smoothest and most profitable transaction possible.

1. Move quickly. When you see something you like, you’ve got to be able to write an offer right away. If you wait a few days to make an offer, the property might be long gone by then.

2. Understand the seller’s needs. You can have your agent reach out to the seller’s agent and ask them what they’re looking for. Do they want a longer escrow period or a larger earnest money deposit? Whatever the case, you can craft your offer to the seller’s liking once you have this information.

“The more you know about the seller, the better offer you can craft.”

3. Have your loan officer call the listing agent. If your loan officer lets the listing agent know personally that you are fully approved and ready to go, it can make a world of difference.

4. Be aggressive with your terms and pricing.

5. Work with an experienced real estate agent. I’ve been in the business since 1979 and last year, my team sold 169 properties. You want an experienced agent that knows this market.

I’d like to apply for the job of helping you buy your next home. If you need my help or if you just have any questions, you can give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

What’s been going on in our summertime market lately?

We have very limited inventory, and the good news for sellers is homes are selling with multiple bids and for more than their listed price—sometimes even above their appraised value.

“The news is good for sellers in our market.”

Our average days on market is fewer than 30 days, home prices are 5% to 7% higher compared to this time last year, and this momentum doesn’t seem like it will slow down for the rest of the summer or the foreseeable future.

If you have any other questions about the state of our current market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to assist you.

Today I wanted to talk to you about some exciting news that I just heard about.

The three credit agencies are changing the way that they’re reviewing credit scores, so 12 million people are going to their scores boosted anywhere from 10 to 20 points. This is exciting news for the consumers. With a higher credit score, you can get a lower interest rate and with a lower rate, you have more buying power to get a more expensive home.

“With a lower rate, you have more buying power to get the home of your dreams.”

So this is a brand-new opportunity that just came this July that I wanted to pass on to you. This way we can help you get qualified for a bigger loan amount and help you get that home that you’ve been looking for.

If you have any questions or you’re looking to buy or sell your home, give me a call. I’d be happy to help you.

A few of my clients have been speaking with me recently about the fact that the stock market is at an all-time high and they are worried that a market correction is imminent. No matter when or if this correction comes, it’s smart to have a balanced portfolio. That means having money in the stock market and in other places, like real estate investments.

“I’d be happy to sit down with you.”

There is a lot of information to understand when investing in real estate and it can get confusing. Knowing about cap rates, gross rate multipliers, and how they affect your numbers is important but can be tricky. I’ve been dealing with these types of investments for 37 years now and have many investment properties myself. If you have any questions about them, I can surely answer them. I’d be happy to sit down with you and explain to you how these things work and how you can use the information to make a smart decision.

If you have any questions for me or just want to talk, give me a call or send me an email. I would be glad to hear from you.

What does your yard look like this spring?

I’ve once again enlisted the advice from Mike of Mike’s Custom Lawn Care to give you some pointers on gardening and lawn care. This is the prime season to plant your vegetable garden and add some color around the exterior of your property with flowers. We had a great winter that produced lots of water, so if you haven’t done so already, now is the time to get started on these items.

Ideally, you want to prepare your soil with fertilizers and mulches. It’s also a great time to plant your annuals so your summer color can go into effect. Pansies, primroses, primulas, and snapdragons are all great at adding color to small areas with bare spots.

“Now is the time to add some color to your property.”

It’s also a good idea to check your sprinklers and readjust your timers to prevent overwatering and make sure they’re watering the areas they’re intended for and not producing any runoff that might go into the street or a neighboring property.

If you have any questions about gardening and/or maintaining your yard this time of year, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. You can also reach Mike at (818) 842-2660. We’d be happy to help you!

        <description>

The cost of living here in the LA area is quite high, so many millennials are having trouble saving for a down payment. Luckily, there’s a great option to get them into a home.

An increasingly popular option for millennials is for their parents to gift them the funds for a home. Instead of leaving money to their children when they pass away, they are making use of the money now so their children can purchase a house. Interest rates are low right now, so it’s a great time for parents to get their kids into a new home.

“Interest rates are low right now, so it’s a great time for parents to get their kids into a new home.”

        <description>

I’ve gotten a few questions lately from some clients I’ve worked with in multiple offer situations regarding their deposit, so today I want to talk about how this can influence your offer in the eyes of sellers.

If you’re a buyer involved in a multiple offer situation, one thing that can make the attraction between you and the seller greater is increasing the deposit that you place with your offer. A typical offer on a home comes with a deposit of 3%, but if you’re competing with and bidding against someone else, it’s better to increase your deposit to 5% or even 10%.

“In today’s market, it’s very important to put your best foot forward.”

Another thing you can do is write a letter to the seller about how wonderful their house is and how you can see you and your family in that house.

In today’s market, it’s very important to put your best foot forward when you’re involved in a multiple offer situation. Increasing your deposit from the standard 3% or 5% to 10% will make you stand out from the competition and give you a better opportunity to get the house you want.

If you have any other questions about this topic, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to talking to you soon!

        <description>

I’ve talked to a lot of first-time homebuyers recently that are under the impression that they need to save up a lot of money for their down payment. You should know that there are plenty of down payment options out there for different loans.

You don’t need 10% or 20% to purchase a home. In fact, you can get into a home with FHA financing for just 3.5% down. Rather than saving for years to get to that level, let’s talk about getting you into a home now so you can start looking sooner rather than later and lock in a low rate with a low down payment.

“You don’t need 20%; you only need 3.5%.”

If you have any questions for me or want to hear more about the different financing options out there, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>What’s going on in the market now that interest rates have gone up?

Since the election ended, rates have jumped up. The Fed is talking about raising rates three more times throughout 2017.

Buyers are pouring into the market now in order to lock in a low interest rate. If they wait to buy, they will likely get stuck with a higher interest rate.

There is light inventory right now, which is beneficial to home sellers. If you’ve been thinking about selling your home, I recommend getting on the market as soon as possible. Buyers are ready to make a purchase now and you won’t face as much competition from other sellers.

If you have any other questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

We just wanted to reach out to you today to wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving. Today we have a short video to share with you of our time helping out the Burbank Temporary Aid Center.

They have been serving the Burbank community for 40 years and we figured we should give them some extra help this holiday season. That is why we loaded up a van full of turkeys and took them over!

We help The Burbank Temporary Aid Center out year round, and you can too. They always need food, but those aren’t the only services they offer for the less fortunate. They offer programs for many of the other basic necessities of life, including: Groceries, Lunches, assistance with utility bills, transportation services, limited medical assistance, shower facilities, and laundry facilities.

Here at the Brad Korb Real Estate Group we are so thankful for the support from our friends and family. We invite you to join us in giving thanks and give back this year. For more information about the Burbank Temporary Aid Center and how to donate today, check out their website here. If you have any other questions, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. Thanks, and have a happy Thanksgiving!

        <title>How Accurate Are Zillow’s Zestimates?</title>

        <description>

How accurate are Zestimates? Most of the time, not very. They’re basically a computer program designed to give you a ballpark figure of what the property is worth in today’s market.

How does Zillow determine my home’s value? It gives you a broad range of what’s been sold in the neighborhood, but it doesn’t go into specifics about your exact home. It doesn’t know about what kind of features you’ve got; maybe the kitchen you’ve upgraded, or that big back yard behind the deck, or the fantastic view over the neighborhood. Since Zillow’s Zestimate is a computerized program, it doesn’t know about these things, and that can result in quite a bit of fluctuation between what the real value is and what Zillow says it is. Zillow also can’t measure how market trends function, meaning it can give you a wide estimation of what’s selling in the area, but not in specific niche markets.

How off is Zillow on pricing? If you check their website, you’ll see that they themselves say their Zestimates can be off by as much as 8% to 10%. When you’re talking about the California market, that can result in an extreme difference between Zillow’s price and the real price. The founder of Zillow himself recently sold his home for far less than it should have been because the Zestimate was 10% off.

What goes into pricing your home and why is it important to be accurate? To sell your home for top dollar in today’s market and get the most we can for you, it’s important to examine market trends to know how to compete against the other homes out there. How do we do this? We come to your home and check things like what kind of landscaping you’ve done and what updates you’ve made. From there we make sure these kinds of things are showcased to maximize value.

I have worked with so many wonderful clients over the years, including Chris Cannon. Today, I wanted to share Chris’s story with you all:

“We first met Brad in 2002, when he helped us buy a duplex. That’s the property we now live in, after it paid its own mortgage. We also inherited a triplex in Glendale. We sold our portion and, after five years, Brad moved us into an eight-unit complex, which also pays for itself.”

“We’ve been very happy with Brad and his team. They seem to work very diligently. They also hooked us up with a management company, so we have no worries. They take care of the late night calls, advertising, and any repairs that might be needed.”

If you have any questions about real estate or are interested in working with us, please give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Recently, I’ve had a couple of clients working on their property and doing things that I didn’t think were important in order to get top dollar in the market.

This got me thinking about how I could help others. Before you go and spend any time and money working on things around the house to get it fixed up and ready for sale, talk to an experienced real estate professional who knows about the buyers in your market. They can help you determine the best ways to spend your time and money when updating your home for sale.

Clients often invest money in their house before listing, which is nice for them, but they’re the seller - not the buyer. Whatever they invest in might not be what buyers are looking for in today’s market. This is why we want our sellers to be laser-focused on the best way to spend the least amount of money to get the top dollar in today’s market.

If you have more questions how to spend money wisely when improving your home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to give you advice about preparing your home for the market.

        <description>

In our current market, many properties are getting multiple offers. So how do you handle multiple offers as a buyer or seller?

As a seller, it is very important to get multiple offers in order to drive up the price. With our pricing strategies, we can get you a great offer and promote it to other agents so they have the opportunity to bring other bids in. Drawing multiple offers is a great way to get top dollar for your home.

As a buyer, consider writing a personal letter to the seller. Warm, fuzzy letters about your family, kids, pets, and how you connected with the house or neighborhood can really appeal to sellers. It also helps if you introduce yourself to the seller and talk about how much you love the house.

Recently, one of my buyer’s agents created a fantastic letter that really won the seller’s heart. The property had 10 offers on it, but we were able to help them get their dream home!

If you have any questions about how to navigate a multiple offer situation, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

A lot of people have been asking me about the real estate market in Los Angeles, and so today I’ll update you with statistics that will tell us more about the health and wealth of this market. We’re currently in a seller’s market in almost all price ranges. Inventory is very low, so multiple offers are common and sale prices remain high.

Home values in LA are still rising, and appreciation is still on the rise. We aren’t seeing home values rise as sharply as they used to, but it’s still a great time to sell a home and cash in on that appreciation. The average days on market is currently fewer than 30 days, so the market is moving very quickly right now.

Where are we seeing the hottest real estate markets? I would recommend looking at homes in Glendale, Burbank, the NoHo District, Toluca Lake, Lake Balboa, all of the areas in the Valley, and East LA.

If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would love to share some more information with you!

        <description>

If you’re considering selling your home, when is the right time to call your Realtor to get your home ready to go on the market?

Recently I had some clients spending time and money on things that I actually thought weren’t important to get top dollar in their market.

Before you spend that time and money, just give me a call! I’ll come out and give you a free market overview and point out some things that as a Realtor, I think are important to fix up in order to sell for top dollar. Too many times sellers invest in upgrades that are nice in their eyes, rather than thinking about what will appeal to buyers.

We want sellers laser-focused on the best ways to spend the least amount of money to get top dollar in today’s market.

Reach out to me and let’s do a walkthrough. I look forward to seeing you soon!

Today, I’m here with Karin Marganian and she works for Style My Space. She’s going to give us some pointers on how to stage your home. You want your home to look its finest, so you can earn top dollar!

Small changes can easily separate your home from the competition. For example, declutter your property.  Clear off the countertops in the bathrooms and kitchens. Put unnecessary items in storage. Move some furniture around in order to maximize the space  in your home.

Also, ensure your yard is maintained well and clean. Curb appeal is incredibly important. You only get one chance at a first impression, so make sure the outside of your home is inviting.

Another simple tip is to air out your home so that everything smells fresh. That way, when potential buyers come in, they will feel at ease in your space.

Karen can come out and walk through your home room by room to figure out the best way to stage your property. We’ll give you pointers and tips to get you top dollar in today’s market. If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Right now, the interest rate market is incredible. We are seeing most people get rates in the mid-3%’s, which has drawn tons of buyers into the market earlier than expected. This is why we are telling sellers to get their homes on the market as soon as possible, because these low rates are only going to continue to attract buyers.

Even in the last few weeks, interest rates have fallen. In addition to that fact, there are a ton of different down payment assistance and first-time buyer programs out there that are making homes a whole lot more affordable than they used to be.

If you have any questions for us about interest rates or the real estate market in general, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Today, we want to introduce you to James Lester.

James is a buyer specialist who joined the Brad Korb Real Estate Team in 2013. He left a nationally recognized real estate company and was able to sell two times the national average once joining the team.

By working with the Brad Korb Team in a team atmosphere, he was able to be mentored by a top-tier Realtor, coached by some of the top coaches, and provided the best systems available to agents.

The Korb Team’s market introduced James to many clients, but there are a few that really stand out. One was a first-time home buyer looking to get into the highly desirable Burbank area of Los Angeles. James showed them a few homes, introduced them to a lender, and helped them settle in their dream home in the area they desired. He would love to do the same for you!

If you want to reach James directly, shoot him an email at James@BradKorb.com or reach out to the Brad Korb Real Estate Team. We would love to hear from you!

After having a contest for the best drought resistant lawn in Burbank, we received lots of important questions. Today, we invited Mike the Gardener from Burbank to talk about drought resistant lawns and what’s going on this season. In this video, we’ll give you tips on how you can conserve water this season.

This time of year, plant preparation is important to consider for the future. What you do now affects what happens in the following spring. Take care of the soil, add fertilizers or mulches, and garden new plants early. Gardening plants early helps them benefit from naturally occurring processes, including natural rainfall and cooling temperature of the ground. From moisture and a relaxed temperature combined, spring flowers will form better, more organic roots. This process, if repeated every fall, will help conserve water gradually over time.

Additionally, it’s a good practice to check your sprinklers and choose the right plants for your garden. Use the best plants suited for the climate you live in.

We are very fortunate to have great families, good jobs, and warm homes to go to during the Holidays. Unfortunately, this isn’t a reality for everyone in our area.

That’s why we always help the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. Every year, they provide over 1,000 turkeys to families in need. This is our sixth year in a row, and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon!

We need your help! If you’d like to donate your time or some turkeys, please get in touch with us.

As always, refer to us as your #1 resource for real estate in the LA area!

Today we just wanted to give all of the sellers out there a quick market update as we head into the fall season. The market has been very strong so far this fall, and we are off to a fantastic start.

In September, we closed and gave the keys to 22 different buyers! In September, we had another 17 homes go under contract, a very strong number for this time of year.

The pace isn’t quite as crazy as it was this summer, but we are still seeing a lot of buyers on the market. Many of them are buyers who wanted to buy in the summer, but were tired of getting outbid on multiple offer situations. These buyers are back looking to buy, so they can take advantage of our historically low interest rates. They are going to go up at some point soon, but for now, they remain near 4%.

With the number of sales we have been seeing recently, and the number of buyers that we know are on the market, it’s a great time to sell. If you want to take advantage of these great market conditions and sell your home, give us a call or send us an email. We have the knowledge and expertise to get your home sold for top dollar this fall. We look forward to hearing from you!

Happy October! We just wanted to give a quick market update today for all of the buyers out there and let them know what’s going on in the market at this moment.

We are still seeing a very strong market, and the great news for buyers is that the market has cooled off a bit from the summer. You won’t have to deal with as many multiple offer situations and bidding wars like you did a couple months ago. A lot of buyers who experienced this in the summer have come back to the market and have been able to get the home they want.

In addition to the number of options out there, interest rates remain historically low. Buying now will save you money in the long run, as a lower interest rate means you can pay off your mortgage faster.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!

This video is especially for the buyers out there trying to compete with multiple bids. I wanted to give you a couple quick tips to help you obtain a home with multiple offers.

One thing that home sellers love seeing is letters. Write a letter to the seller of the home and include some pictures of you and your family. Let them know a little about you and why you love their home. If the owner is actually living in the house, you can always stop by and drop the letter off in person, and thank the sellers for considering your offer. A little personal touch can go a long way in a deeply emotional transaction like this.

Just wanted to share that quick tip with you today! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, we are only a phone call away. Talk to you soon!

Hey everyone, thanks for joining us again. This video is for the sellers out there. Today we are going to teach you how to deal with multiple offers on your home.

Since there is such low inventory in LA, it is a great time to sell and receive multiple offers on your home. We try to give everyone an opportunity to submit an offer on your home that wants to, and if there are multiple bids, we let each party know so everyone can submit their highest and best offer, and we can drive up the price.

When dealing with multiple offers, it’s also critical to look at the buyer. Do they have a pre-approval letter with the offer? Do they have substantial funds? How much money are they planning on putting down?

We want to help guide you through the process and find the best offer for you. I’d love to speak to you personally about it in a little more detail. If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. Bye for now!

Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by once again. Today I just wanted to give you a quick update on how the LA real estate market is doing.

It’s now May, and the market should continue to be just as strong as it was in April. There is still a very limited supply of inventory, which is fantastic for sellers.

For buyers, this market is a little more challenging. Make sure to get your pre-approval letter and have it ready to go with your offer. Be patient; if you don’t get your first or second choice, there are still plenty of great options out there for you in this market.

If you have any questions about our market, or about anything else real estate related, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>
Hey everyone, happy April to you. First off, I wanted to say thank you so much for sending in all of your great questions. I’m going to answer a few of them today for you. Most of them have had to do with mortgages, refinancing, and interest rates, so we thought we would bring in Brian McKim of Skyline Home Loans to help answer them.

How often can I refinance?This is a great question. You can refinance as many times as it makes sense for you. There are no longer any pre-payment penalties, so you can refinance 2 or 3 times a year if it makes sense to. What we mean by “making sense” is that if the refinance will save you money down the road and you can afford it, you should do it.

When and how can I refinance if I’m planning to sell in the future?If you are planning on selling in the next 18-24 months, it probably doesn’t make much sense for you to refinance. You’ll want to give yourself enough time to reap the benefits of getting a lower rate, and that probably won’t happen for at least 2 years.

There you have it. Thanks to Brian for joining us today and helping answer some of your questions. If you have any more questions for us, or for Brian, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to be of assistance to you!

Thanks for joining me once again today. I just wanted to give you some news about what has been happening with interest rates on mortgages. In the past few months, rates have dipped below historical lows and sit below 4% in most places. Because of this decrease in rates, Fannie Mae has recently agreed to offer a 97% loan program as opposed to a 95% loan program.

This is going to help first time buyers get into the market sooner rather than later. With low interest rates and even lower down payments, things are setting up perfectly for that first-time buyer to get into a new home. In addition, the FHA has lowered their private mortgage insurance premiums, making your monthly payment even lower.

With conditions the way they are, buyers and sellers need to take advantage. Right now, you can afford more of a home and secure a lower monthly payment than you ever could have. If you have any questions about how these programs can help you as a buyer, give me a call or send me an email.

Today we have Paul with us, who was really apprehensive to sell his home. Agents had been telling him he needed to sell to a real estate investor because the home needed too much work. Paul expected to get $650,000 for his property, and other agents laughed at him and told him that it might be worth $500,000.

When he decided to work with us, we took the right steps to brighten his home and liven it up. We took down drapes, removed awnings, and opened up windows to make it feel fresh and new inside.

Paul ended up with 21 offers in seven days and had a selling price that was $130,000 over the appraised value.

If you want a fast, clean, and efficient sale, be sure to contact myself or my team. We would be very happy to serve you.

There’s some exciting news for the Los Angeles real estate this January. For starters, interest rates have fallen to right around 3.7%.

This will result in buyers coming out sooner than usual. With affordability on the rise, you can expect to see a busy Los Angeles marketplace.

Sellers are also making their way onto the market and listing homes in response to the increase in buying power. There usually is not a lot of demand from buyers in January, but 2015 is different, and the market is off to an extremely hot start.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, it’s a good time to get in the market. Interest rates are as low as they’ve been in 20 months,  causing a flurry of activity in Los Angeles and in the rest of the nation.

If you need any assistance, whether you’re buying or selling in LA, please be sure to call or email me. My team of professionals are waiting to hear from you!

Hi again, everybody. We just wanted to reach out to you today to wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving. Today we have a short video to share with you of our time helping out at the Burbank Temporary Aid Center.

They have been serving the Burbank community for 40 years and we figured we should give them some extra help this holiday season. That is why we loaded up a van full of turkeys and took them over!

We help The Burbank Temporary Aid Center out year round, and you can too. They always need food, but those aren’t the only services they offer for the less fortunate. They offer programs for many of the other basic necessities of life, including: Groceries, Lunches, assistance with utility bills, transportation services, limited medical assistance, shower facilities, and laundry facilities.

If you would like some more information about the Burbank Temporary Aid Center, check out their website here. If you have any other questions, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. Thanks, and have a happy Thanksgiving!

Tune in to ABC’s and CNBC’s Shark Tank to see Brad side-by-side with real estate magnate Barbara Corcoran.

Corcoran is Shark Tank’s resident real estate mogul and a prominent self-made multi-millionaire. She is now endorsing a select few of the best real estate minds in the country, Brad being included. Brad will appear in a commercial airing in several episodes throughout the season.

Brad’s company, The Brad Korb Real Estate Group, is a dominant leader in the real estate industry, providing phenomenal service and expertise to a wide base of clientele in the Los Angeles area.

“To sell your home on time for the most money, you need a sharp agent with a marketing strategy that creates the most demand,” Corcoran said. “Bottom line, you need a partner willing to put their own money on the line for you …. Brad Korb knows how to attract the right kind of buyers and create so much demand that if your home doesn’t sell at a price and deadline you agree to, Brad will buy it!”

Corcoran is an iconic figure in the New York real estate scene and nationally known as the real estate contributor to the NBC TODAY show. She has invested in more than two dozen businesses to date on Shark Tank, and has written several well-received books including Shark Tales: How I turned $1,000 into a Billion Dollar Business.

“It’s very gratifying to be among the handful of real estate agents endorsed by Barbara. I’ve always admired her because she understands small businesses and the importance of investing money to help others achieve success. That’s exactly what I do for my clients,” Korb said. “I hope everyone tunes in to Shark Tank to see the endorsement of Barbara Corcoran. I’m proud to be affiliated with it!”

P.S. You may also see Barbara’s endorsement at www.ITrustBrad.com!

It was a crazy busy summer here in the Burbank area, but the fall is here and the market has cooled off a bit. Because of this slight slowdown, many people are asking whether they should wait until the busy spring season to sell their home. This is a great question - to answer it, let’s take a look at interest rates because they have the biggest impact on your spending power.

Say you get a $600,000 mortgage with the current interest rate of about 4.25%. Your monthly payments will only be $2,900 a month. Local lenders predict those low interest rates to rise next year. If you wait to buy, interest rates may be as high as 5.5%. If you lock

in a 5.25% rate next year, you will have lost 10% of your purchasing power! This means you will have to pay the same price for less home - you’ll have to pass on that $600,000 mortgage for a more affordable $540,000 one.

It’s really quite simple: If you are ready to buy, it’s probably not wise to wait. Now is the time to take advantage of fantastic rates and find your dream home. If you would like any assistance, or have any questions about real estate in our area, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We would love to give you a hand!

        <description>
Happy October, everyone! We just wanted to share with you an interesting story that we heard recently. It’s sort of a cautionary tale about refinancing while switching career paths.

Recently, our former Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, was denied refinancing for a new mortgage. Why? Well, Bernanke is now retired from the Federal Reserve, using his time now to be a speaker and author. Because of this career shift, lenders determined that he had no job stability, and therefore could no longer qualify for refinancing. Hopefully they will loosen up these standards soon to help out home buyers.

The moral of this story is: If you’re thinking about buying a house and changing job fields at the same time, reach out to us and give us a call so we can run everything by our lender. Sometimes, but not always, when you switch job fields, you have to wait a while to buy another home because you have to gain some experience and tenure in your new field.

We thought this would be an important story to share with you, and we hope you are enjoying your October. If you have any questions, please give us a call! We’d be glad to help!

        <description>
Recently, we sold a house for Bill Carroll of KFI talk radio. Bill has been a great client of ours and has been talking about us for a long time on KFI. The thing that Bill says he likes most about us is our system.

“I love their system. Their team guarantees to sell your home on a certain date on an agreed-upon price and if they don’t, they’ll buy it from you. So of course, when it’s time to sell our house, I had to call the Brad Korb Team,” Bill said.

Bill had sold homes in the past, but they had always taken weeks, even months to sell. We are happy to report that once we got a hold of Bill’s listing, we sold the home after being on the market for only 4 days. We got multiple offers and offers above appraisal value.

If you have any questions about how we sell homes, or any other real estate question, please let us know. We would be glad to answer them.

Happy Fall, everyone. It’s hard to believe that the summer is nearly over. We thought that now would be a great time to give you the latest real estate market update for Los Angeles so you can know what’s going on.

The market is still fantastic, we have had houses going on the market this week and have some set up for next week as well. For some reason, people think that the market slows down in the fall because of the weather, but we are in LA, and we really don’t have your typical fall (or winter for that matter), so our selling season never really stops.

We are still seeing extremely low interest rates down near 4.25%. Properties in this market that are showing well are selling and we are going to have beautiful weather for showing homes here for the next couple of months.

If you have any questions about the market, or about real estate in general, please give us a call. We’d love to help you out!

        <description>
Today we want to reach out to you to talk about home protection policies. We recently sold a few homes belonging to senior citizens who hardly ever used their appliances or air conditioning. Not all home buyers will be lucky enough to move into a house like this with rarely used appliances and A/C. When things break, rather than going back to the seller with a broken A/C, if you have a home protection policy, you can get it fixed easily for as little as $55 or $60.

If you don’t have that policy, you could be looking at spending between $1500-$3500 to fix it. Having your appliances covered by a home protection policy gives you great peace of mind. If something goes wrong, you can give us a call and we’ll help you call the home protection company and get you taken care of.

If you have any questions, please give us a call. We would be happy to help you out.

        <description>
Did you know that 98% of Los Angeles home searches now begin online? This is the first impression your home will get from a potential buyer and likely the first place you will look for your next home. While websites like Trulia and Zillow are great for doing research on homes that already have sold, their information on current market statistics isn’t really all that current or accurate.

These sites all have different equations and algorithms for how to get an estimate for your home. The problem is that they don’t always have up-to-date information. The information they are getting on homes is from 3-6 months ago.

If prices have dropped in your Los Angeles neighborhood in the last few months, this will not reflect the actual value of your home in the current market.

For buyers, they also don’t put price reductions up right away and they don’t update information on homes that are pending sales. You may be looking and asking about properties that have long since been sold.

It’s important to talk to a real estate expert about what the true value of your home should be. Our team can give you up-to-date information and a current market analysis of all the homes in your area.

If you want to know more about how to get an accurate price on your home, please give us a quick call or e-mail. We would love to give you more information.

Before I begin this market update I would like to wish you a happy Father’s Day. I hope you’ll be able to enjoy the day and sit around a barbecue with all of your family - you deserve it!

Now - here’s what is happening with Burbank real estate:


  Interest rates have been on a roller coaster recently. They were at 4.5% a few weeks ago and then dropped down to 4.1%, and have now risen back to 4.25%. However, 4.25% is still a phenomenal interest rate.
  Inventory in Burbank has also risen slightly, but it’s nothing too significant. We still have less homes for sale now than we did last year.


Because most people like to move into homes in the summer, now is your chance to sell your Burbank home quickly and for top dollar. Decreased inventory will bolster your chances of selling and low interest rates will push buyers into purchasing while homes are still affordable.

If you need any assistance in buying or selling homes in the Burbank area, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for tuning in!

        <description>
I just wanted to reach out to you today to remind you that with spring on the way, it’s time to act accordingly if you’re in the process of selling a home.

It’s been very warm here in Burbank lately, and because of this I wanted to remind you to make sure that your lawn is looking nice and fresh. This can include:* Making sure your sprinklers are working correctly* Manicuring your lawn to make sure the grass is as green as possible* Planting your flowers in their beds* Trimming your trees and bushes

These are just a handful of ways you can improve your front yard to attract potential buyers. Curb appeal is very important in the spring, and because it has been so warm in Burbank, it’s time to put our best foot forward. Take advantage of this warm weather and prep your home, as well as your yard, for sale.

If you need help finding gardeners or landscapers, please contact me because I have a few trusted workers that I can recommend. Also, if you want any help buying or selling Burbank real estate, call me at (818) 953-5300 or email me at Brad@BradKorb.com

Please help us welcome Courtney Korb to the team! Joining her dad, Courtney Korb will be taking on all the hiring and training of new Buyer Agents in the role of Sales Manager. She will also be handling all online leads resulting from online marketing.

Having recently purchased a home, Courtney shares with us her experiences as a first-time home-buyer with the hopes in helping new buyers prepare for the biggest purchase of their lives. Here are her tips:

Explore the neighborhood(s) you are considering – drive around at various times of day; research the schools, shopping, city management, parks and recreation and amenities. Do they suit your lifestyle?

Get pre-approved by a local lender – this will help you pinpoint a price range so you can narrow down your search for what you are looking for and what you can afford.

Identify which features of a home are important – so you can be able to differentiate quality features from cosmetic ones. Simple fixes may not cost too much to resolve whereas you can recover a much more significant return on your investment with some features.

Don’t expect perfection – rather be realistic and keep an open mind. Small fixes are easy to manage and as long as you can overlook them you can find a great deal on a good home!

Sometimes it takes more than one try – at times the first home you make an offer on is not the perfect home. Don’t get anxious about it, just move on to the next home!

~ We look forward to introducing you to Courtney the next time you come into the office to discuss your real estate needs! See you soon…

        <title>Should you invest in an income property?</title>

        <description>
Lately, a few people have asked me whether income properties are a worthwhile investment. Without a doubt, the answer is yes. Real estate is a great way to earn an income and control your investment. Also, because you have a more active role in the success of the investment, the risk is much lower than other venues.

Compared to the stock market, investing in income properties is a no-brainier. With stocks, you have no direct impact on a given company’s success besides the money you supply. However, with income properties you can be both financially and physically engaged. I really believe in this venture, so much so that I recently helped my daughter buy her first income property and I plan on using my income property as my retirement plan.

Lately, a few people have asked me whether income properties are a worthwhile investment. Without a doubt, the answer is yes. Real estate is a great way to earn an income and control your investment. Also, because you have a more active role in the success of the investment, the risk is much lower than other venues.

        <title>Should You Sell During the Holiday Season?</title>

        <description>
Traditional school of thought dictates that selling a home during the holidays is a bad idea. People are busy celebrating with their families and will hardly go shopping for a home, right? Not so! There are numerous advantages to listing a home during this season and below are ten great reasons to put a home on the market now.

More serious buyers – Less time wastedThese are people who are interested in buying so there is a far greater chance of actually selling the property.  Nothing is more promising to a seller than a motivated and qualified buyer that knows what they want and is actively seeking to get it.

Fewer Homes On the MarketThe less competition there is, the higher the chance there is for homes on the market to sell. Where during the peak season sellers might be dealing with some interest from buyers on their home, nonetheless there is more selection for buyers to choose from and they can stray to another property.

In January Inventory Increases – Chances of Selling DecreasesWith so many homeowners assuming the holidays is a taboo time to sell there is a plethora of new listings in January, resulting in a diminished chance of your home selling.  Also, there is a risk that the price you may receive on the home can be less.

Decked Halls Look Great!Homes are very appealing to prospective buyers when they are decorated for the holidays.  With all the festive décor, lights, greenery and added beauty of the season – the home shows very well and attracts buyers faster than if shown during other times of the year.

More Time To Browse HomesBuyers have extra time off from work and are on vacation, which translates to a more aggressive buying pattern and more chances of your home being viewed.

More Emotional BuyersBecause of the high stress of the holidays, buyers tend to be more emotional during this time than in the summer months. A more emotional buyer will tend to pay more for a new property, so selling your home during the holidays could make you more money.

Show The Home With FlexibilitySellers that have their home listed prior to the holidays have the added advantage to be able to “pause” the process so they can celebrate the holidays, essentially not showing the home during a period of time during the break.  When the festivities die down, things can pick up again and the seller has not only managed to save potentially lost time but can also jump right back into the market.

Transferred EmployeesJanuary is typically the month where employees are transferred into new position. In order to capture this demographic of buyers, your home must be on the market since these buyers cannot wait until the spring to buy.

Sell Now For More Money Then Delay ClosingExtended occupancy can be negotiated, leaving both parties the leniency to get through the holiday season and past the New Year so that all sides can rest assured the deal is done but it can follow through at a more convenient time.  For sellers this option is great because they are able to secure a higher selling price on the property before the market is inundated with new listings come January when the selling values drop.

Fewer Foreclosures On the MarketMany banks will suspend foreclosure listing during this time of year, especially on properties where there are still families occupying the home.  As a result of this, some of the competition that arises for sellers from low-priced foreclosures can be avoided during the holidays.

Keep in mind that the idea of your home’s value increasing significantly over the next several months is a myth.  The truth is that housing values likely only go up when consumer income rises. Pay rates increase at a rate of three to five percent each year and that is about the maximum yearly increase we can expect to see in a home as well. So if you are wondering whether or not to put your home on the selling market now, or to wait – one important factor is that waiting will not provide much benefit.

Welcome back. Thanks for joining me today. I wanted to talk about home inspections.

Home inspections are important for both buyers and sellers, but today I wanted to focus especially on why it’s important for sellers to get an inspection prior to listing their home.

Why?

A lot of sellers aren’t aware of the true health of their home. When was the last time you checked the foundation of your home? What shape is your roof in?

Once a seller gets the report on their home, they can make the necessary changes. That way when a buyer makes an offer, you can hand them the report. There also won’t be any surprises when a buyer has their inspector come through.

If you have any questions about how to prepare your home for the market, give me a call 818.958.5300

Thanks for watching!

Welcome back! If you’re getting your home ready to sell, it’s important to know how to appeal to buyers. What is it that they want to see when they view your home? Here are four important elements of preparing your home.


  Curb Appeal. The front of your home is the first impression buyers have. Make sure you have a well-kept lawn, plant some new flowers and if needed, put on a fresh coat of paint.
  Lighting. Buyers want a bright home. Put the maximum wattage light bulbs in and open all the shades and curtains.
  Remove all personal items. When a buyer looks at your home it’s important they imagine themselves living in the home; that can be hard when pictures of your family vacation are everywhere.
  Staging. We have a professional stager on our team that can help make your home appear more spacious and appealing to buyers.


If you have any questions about how to prepare your home, please give me a call!

Welcome to my video blog. I wanted to wish you a happy beginning of fall! And what a great fall it is.

Normally the months following summer slow our market down. Since interest rates have been on the rise, though, we’ve seen an influx of buyers. Buyers understand that as rates increase, they continue to lose purchasing power.

We are seeing aggressive buyers who are motivated to make great offers. Now is a great time to sell your home! So give me call and we can get your home on the market!

Thanks for watching!

        <description>
Many buyers in the marketplace can’t find the home of their dreams because there’s simply not enough inventory to choose from. It’s certainly a sellers’ market. Sellers have the upper hand, especially if the home is in good condition, located in a great neighborhood and priced just right. If you’re at all on the fence about selling, now is the time because sellers are getting top dollar for their homes and they are selling faster than they could have imagined.

Since there are fewer homes on the market, there’s more competition for available homes. Low inventory often translates into multiple bids for homes in good condition, high list-to-sale price ratios and being able to negotiate better terms. It’s an ideal time for sellers.

So when selling your home, if you want to get top dollar for your property, take advantage of the low inventory. Here’s the thing: supply and demand affect what you’ll get for your home. When everyone who has been thinking about selling their home puts their home on the market is not the time to dive in—if you want to get the most out of your home. At the end of the day, you have a better chance at success if you decide to sell now, instead of waiting until all the Joneses get into the market.

To help you position yourself for success, please call us at (818) 953-5300.

For years now, buyers have been able to come in fairly low and actually get away with offers that sellers would never have accepted just a few years prior to that. But now, things are shifting back to a more balanced marketplace and we are noticing some big changes in the way buyers and sellers are interacting. Here are some ways you can gain the upper hand over other buyers vying for the same (few) properties that are scarcely available in our market today.

Don’t Hold Back When You Find Something You Like

A common mistake made by many buyers in a competitive market is to hold off on making an offer on something they really like. The chance of finding a home that meets every single need is next to impossible, that’s why it is important to recognize your deal breakers and if you like the home for the most part, go ahead and make an offer on it.

If You’re Serious, Present a Serious Offer – The First Time

Now is not the time to be playing games when it comes to trying to get the home of your dreams. With so few homes on the market and so many buyers, there is a good chance you could lose the home altogether if your offer is not strong enough. Carefully consider your offer and act as if that is your only chance.

Engage in the Services of a Local Expert

There is a lot of merit to working with a local real estate agent that knows the area and knows other agents in the area. At times, when all else fails, a seller may opt for your offer just because their agent also knows your agent. Not to mention, the expert advice you can expect from your REALTOR® in being able to recognize a good deal among other things.

Structure An Offer That Makes the Seller Happy

One of the strongest signs of a serious buyer is a large deposit. Though the standard varies from area to area, typically at least 1% is put toward earnest money and it shows some level of seriousness on the buyer’s part when they go above that.

Other things you can do to make sure sellers pay more attention to your offer and less to others include writing a personal letter to share what you love about the home or be willing to waive contingencies or at least shorten contingencies. Savvy buyers also work to keep their offers simple, clean and easy to read plus they don’t hesitate to offer cash if they can do it, shortening the time period between now and closing.

If you don’t need closing cost assistance, don’t ask for it and finally – if you really love the property, do what works best – offer more money.
