  - quote: Bob Sokoler's company including Amy Hill and Randy Raque always were a very big help in finding me a home.  Amy would send me twenty house and condominium listings three to four days a week, and get me appointments as soon as possible to look at what I was interested in to narrow down my search for   my perfect home.  If there were any questions that I had, they were always answered right away.  I was able to find my perfect home in a little bit over two weeks.   This is why I highly recommend Bob Sokoler's Real Estate team to help you find any excellent house and/or condominium in the Louisvile area.

Their network and connections are second to none and their knowledge of the city and housing market helped us discover a beautiful home we otherwise wouldn't have found. I also love that you can use their moving truck for   free. A+ all around!
