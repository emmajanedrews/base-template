Dear Real Estate Agent:

I understand you may be working at a real estate brokerage or you may be a newer agent just getting started.

For some people, getting started in the real estate industry can be difficult. **According to Real Estate Coach Tom Ferry, 87% of real estate agents fail in their first five years.** That means nine out of 10 agents won’t be working in real estate five years from now.

Struggling agents who only do two deals a year may go to a fee-based company because they are told when they close a deal, they’ll keep 100%. **Unfortunately, these brokerages don’t have the systems or leads for you to continue getting transactions.** Eventually, 100% of zero is just zero.

Most agents just can’t hang in there long enough to wait for another commission check that might arrive. There’s just too much uncertainty, stress and insecurity.

If you’re lying awake at night wondering where your next deal is coming from, what can you do to turn things around and succeed in this business?

I’m Patrick O’Sullivan, and I’ve been where you are right now. That’s why I want to help you.** I started out as a single agent, and I learned a system that got me 20 closings in my first year in real estate.** My second year, I closed 40 deals, and I have closed over 40 transactions every year after that. I decided to build a team and teach other agents my system. I hired a new agent who wanted to sell real estate part-time and helped him close 12 deals and gross $60,000 in his first year.


12 deals and gross $60,000 in his first year.At Cap Core Real Estate, we are a clound based brokerage that offers all of the broker support, mentoring, systems, and leads that you need to be a successful real estate agent.  **Whether you are interested in residential real estate, commercial real estate, or investment properties, we will be able to educate you about everything you need to know.**

With our team you get: Real Geeks CRM valued at $200/mo, 30 leads a month valued at $750/mo, mentorship and broker support valued at $5,000/mo, an inside sales department valued at $1,000/mo, company training through webinars and in-person, a transaction coordinator for every transaction, free use of company signs and Supra boxes, and the support of three real estate professionals who have 35 years of experience combined.

**If you’re struggling in real estate, you don’t have to solve this on your own.** Other agents might join a 100% fee-based brokerage and be left in the dark with no business. Some agents might try to invest in all of these systems themselves, while others will leave real estate altogether for a 9-to-5 job. That doesn’t have to be you. You don't have to be another number in their system.

I want to offer you a position on our team.

We offer a diverse comp plan that would fit a new agent and a top producer and the education and systems you need to bring in continual, consistent income.

We’re not like other big brokerages that do all the marketing for their 1,000 real estate agents but never teach them how to change the status of a listing on the MLS. **When you work with us, a professional will handle everything, from giving you access to all of our systems to training.** We will sit down with you for an orientation and go over how our company works so that you can fit right into the flow of things.

When you work with us, we will have an hour-long one-on-one meeting each month. We are here to help you build a business and want to make sure that you have everything you need to succeed.

Here’s the thing—we are dedicated to helping agents, but we are only looking for five agents in the next month. Apply now to be one of those five agents.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Patrick O’Sullivan<br>Cap Core Real Estate
