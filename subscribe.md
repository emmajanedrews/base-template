<p class="testimonial-text indent">Dan is a great real estate broker. He has some great ideas and is very helpful with implementing sales plans. He follows through when he says he is going to do something, so many in this business do not. I am proud to work with him! <br>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">Dan Stephenson is a assertive sales leader that has been able to motivate his sales team to reach greater wealth for themselves and the company. Dan has great work ethic, a great sense of humor, and has the initiative to challenge himself and his team to drive for greater than expected results. He has a great judge of hiring quality teams and is very much in his element managing them on a daily basis. His Team admires his mentoring abilities and immediate response to their daily needs. He was promoted as Area Director to manage the Naples office, as well. I would highly recommend Dan in a senior sales, management, and leadership role managing large teams in any sales environment. Having worked in the hospitality and restaurant business for 38 years, I would highly recommend Dan for a management position in this field, as well. Do not hesitate to call me directly for a personal reference. J.Beard 1/2/14 <br>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Dan. He is extremely personable one-on-one as a coach and mentor to his staff. He is a great leader who instills confidence in employees, provides a clear company vision, and fosters a positive, enthusiastic culture. I would highly recommend Dan to any organization that is looking for an experience and dynamic leader who can motivate employees as well as increase sales. <br>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I have had to rewrite this recommendation twice due to the character limitation within Linkedin, however I feel strongly that for those that read this fully understand what kind of leader and individual Dan Stephenson is for our company. I have been in a field for most of my career that requires an entrepreneurial spirit and drive from every level of the organization and Dan's ability motivate and foster that spirit is second to none. It is uncanny that Dan can energize a 40 year veteran and a 3 week old recruit just from his enthusiasm and constant effort to understand his audience. Dan's role within our organization rapidly grew as his personalization of technology training and positive influence was measurable in sales and market share. Dan supports out team of sales executives that used to resist technology as the perception was that it would replace personal interaction. In my time as a business owner and CFO I have not witnessed someone that could so quickly remove the apprehension of technology and prove that it does not create relationships…it enhances them. Dan is a thought leader that loves to work and his enthusiasm really is contagious. I would recommend Dan, in an instant, for any executive sales leader position that requires passion to succeed, intimate understanding of sales statistics and trends and a personal interest in all of those that he leads. <br>
